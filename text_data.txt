Reddit programmers are absolute re\`tards.  It notifies you that there's "1 new comment" as a little popup even if it's your OWN comment. How stupid is that?  Also Automoderator posts should not count for the total comment count. Nobody is clicking on a thread with "1 comment" to see the moderator. Total comments should only include real users.

“One of the saddest lessons of history is this: If we’ve been bamboozled long enough, we tend to reject any evidence of the bamboozle. We’re no longer interested in finding out the truth. The bamboozle has captured us. It’s simply too painful to acknowledge, even to ourselves, that we’ve been taken. Once you give a charlatan power over you, you almost never get it back.”   \-Carl Sagan

I personally think the markets might have a correction coming, AAPL has been at an all time high for the past three weeks basically and its due for a minor correction, might be a good time to buy into it for those $200 calls.

1. Cava puts   When an IPO is priced to double on the first day it almost always ends up lower than the offering price (was 22 pre ipo price). It's priced to pop then for two years there is no bid for it in other words it just collapses. The company also is losing money heading into a recession.  2. Looking for an entry point for TGT calls. Article linked is good DD  https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/sectors/sp500-stocks-reliably-jump-30-every-time-a-bear-market-ends/  Target outperforms when we enter a new bull market historically. It's usually a 2.5  or less yielding stock it's not the 4 percenter type of dividend stock.   We haven't had a correction yet this year and usually we have 1 to 2 every year in a bull market. That's where the index drops 10 percent before going back up higher. I feel people are too bullish right now and that things will cool off or it will just be a broader market rally instead of AI and big tech which is a great reason to choose Target.

Me: So you allow anyone above the age of 4 to gamble on options with parental permission. Is that correct?  USA: Yep!  Me: And you’re allowed to join the military at 18?  USA: Correct.  Me: So what happens if I gamble under 21?  USA: 6 MONTHS JAIL AND A CRIMINAL RECORD! YOU WILL BE FORBIDDEN TO KEEP ANY OF YOUR WINNINGS! DONT EVEN FUCKING THINK ABOUT IT! IN FACT, IT’S ILLEGAL TO EVEN HANG OUT IN THE CASINO!

AI is going to hurt GOOGL in the long run. 60% of Google’s revenue comes from search ads, and far fewer ads can be shown during a GPT-like query result.  GOOGL has no choice but to cannibalize a huge chunk of its own ad revenue. It needs to develop AI to stay relevant, but will lose ad revenue if AI queries becomes the default way people search for information.  Short GOOGL.  It’s about lose like, 50% of its current ad revenue, which is 30% of its TOTAL revenue.  Do it now before more people catch on. You’re welcome.

Question guys. As I grow my options account the size of my calls or puts grow in number. Has anybody here ever set off an unusual options activity alert? The way they put it is saying there might be someone who knows something about a specific stock but really its just wsb traders alot of times on the last leg of our making it to over million. In options from a new car price of 25k you really only are 2 or 3 options trades in a row to over a million. It's so much different than buying shares. I know you can only have 5000 calls or puts on any stock in one robinhood account.

Once the big OEMs start mass producing EVs, RIVN is going to be squeezed out. Wouldn’t touch it with a 10 foot pole
They have no foothold on the market, they will be eaten alive their cars are just novelties at this point
This dude thinks Rivian is the same as Tesla. Wtf lmao

Recent earnings were positive with more interest in the technology and it's gaining volume / momentum that reminds me of 2020-2021 when it went nuts and I made a small 6 figure gain on it. Not really expecting that much this time but I'm already up a fair amount on the position I started again in early June and I've been adding to it. Also seems fairly safe since the entire market cap is a few hundred million less than their cash on hand with very little debt. Very healthy balance sheet.

Solid brother. The most likely outcome is it collapses post-IPO hype, ala DoorDash, AirBNB, Palantir, etc. to lower than IPO price. A $10 share price would make for a much more reasonable valuation than the current price. It might not fall that far, but I can definitely see it go between $15-$20 in the medium to long term

Long story short they’re getting taken advantage of by [“Ashley”](https://imgur.com/a/zFM8VqU). They met Ashley at a liquor store and after drinking with her became friends. The hotel rooms are in Ashley’s name and she takes the white girls’ cars without permission(she just takes the keys). Ashley invited the 10 random guys over but kicked them out.   When I arrived Ashley and her female friends were in the white girls’ room but left to go to her hotel room. On the way out Ashley said “I don’t want to hear any noise. Keep that TV down. I don’t want to have to come back” and the girls were scared to turn the TV up or talk loud while I was there lmaooo.   Edit: I was texting one of the homies sitting next to me.

I agree but that's pretty much why I think this is still many years out. I think China wants to have their own semiconductor capacity before they make this move. There is just so much more for them to gain from not invading Taiwan right now. Who knows though.

Basically ipo companies that double on the 1st day end up lower than the offer price later on. There's no bid and people take profits. The company is losing money. I feel that is the best priced puts right now because at 100 dollars that means it's only priced to go 1 dollar below 30 but I feel it's in the 20s soon making that a double triple quadruple maybe more. I feel giving yourself a little premium is much safer than the July puts and it gives you plenty of time to get out later that's why I chose the August 18th 30 strike.
You are right VM but Ford is still interesting for the middle.
Forgot to say.  Every bit of profit I get goes into Tesla. What do you think is going to happen in 10 years?
It didn't work 10 years ago it isn't working now. I feel like the guy gets a free car if he recommends them or something it makes no sense.

Yeah this is my fear. Never had a problem with weed, but also never really had my own. Can get pretty high 3-4 times a week with a friend at night for a month, then not smoke for weeks and it's fine, I don't crave it or anything, but I know having your own stash is different, next thing you know you are smoking every night and can't sleep without, the rest is history. Have many such friends

You think 4 sentences is an essay.   I'm guessing school was not your thing.
Thanks bro. Happy 4th of July to you ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)
Yeah sure I sent you my position.
The reason I think shares are a bad play because there is extremely low volume and it's brand new sitting on a double. It's a bull market yes but the pre ipo holders are gonna fomo sell to lock in gains. There's gonna be no hedge fund bids for it the bid is only retail and thats a really low volume. In the ipo business it's common that an instant double drops dramatically. To me properly priced puts are a free money trade rn in the market. I'd like to meet the hedge fund manager that buys a 100,000 share block or more after an instant double. Even fibanacci ratios alone would suggest a significant decline from here.

why is it though? I also have noticed all the bad teeth of most British people, but why?
when you have thousands of years of history, things like that just get blended in with the many pebbles thrown in the pond of time
I have a decent amount of money. I don’t play with too much of it but I suck at my basic investing. Lost money overall the last couple of years but about even. Mainly banking on one thing and I made money as a bull and didn’t make much during the bull times. I’ve mostly figured out how not to totally f myself over now.

They can, and they will. But there’s just a lot less space/opportunity for them. It will be a decrease in ad displays overall, as we switch from searchbar queries to chatbot queries.
Possibly. Or Google earnings will already be lackluster on July 26 and youll miss the main ride on the gravy train.  Fortune favors the regarded.

their Q1 earnings were actually pretty good, However operating income decreased due to lower gross margins. good luck G
half day with sub par volume and still went up 7% , positive news rally , it will rise up 5-10 usd at least until earnings, after that idk
no. it’s affect did happen, banks went bust.  BUT gov bail out came out at the same time to offset the affects of rate hike   so yeah, they pivoted
But then you have only 1.5 mil insured if the company has a problem.

I agree more premium is better on puts but they go up exponentially in price to buy those that's why I grabbed August because it was around 100 dollars a put which equals a projection it will go 1 dollar below 30. I think it will go much lower than that. I saw the price per put being a great chance to get a triple or more easily on a big sell run while leaving the door open for something massive. I actually got them at 75 dollars a put so the projection is .75 cents below 30 I call bs on that it could be 5 dollars or more below that by then.
I'm gonna send you my position
Nice

Ah didn’t know they were July 26th, problem is everyone keeps shorting and driving this clown market higher, so it’s hard to hit on puts
Yeah you too. Are you playing?
That was a dovish action but they are still net hawkish. Look at money supply and Fed balance sheet. Both declining even despite the emergency bank liquidity a few months ago.
if I'm a billionaire and I can't figure out how not to have robinhood steal.my money then I deserve to lose it all
It's a fast casual restaurant chain losing money but swearing to expand and eventually make profits soon. It's a Mediterranean restaurant that is the equivalent of making your own salad at whole foods (when they have falafel) or a food cart in NYC. There's nothing really special about it except they're growing.
It’s the Mediterranean food version of chipotle

Ligma balls stupid mod
What’s new
Yeah, 100%. It’s all about risk management tbh, put a bit of capital into shorter term puts with lower cost and higher upside, but more money into the relatively safer long term puts that will still make a higher profit than shorting the stock, which you can’t even do right now
Alright, fire away
thank you, good luck to you too sir
Guilty as charged
I urge you to reconsider. It's a bull market. That means indexes. Single stocks can still break the trend. By definition the indexes perform strong on average 3 years from the bear market bottom. That was in October last year. There hasn't been a correction yet this year though. Usually there are 1 to 2 a year. The big money will be made by the bulls until late 2025 unless there is a crash. Specific scenarios can always break trend of course. The indexes never go straight up and there hasn't been a correction this year. Those are your bear cases that might work but the market will turn around and go back up higher. It all sets up the bubble that the next bear market or crash will burst. Pencil it in for late 2025 for the next bear market beginning. Should be a fun time to be a put trader.
oh sweet summer child. u do realize a recession MUST happen to kill of bubble right?   and very clearly the administration isn’t allowing it to happen
Sounds tasty, but yeah kinda weird they’re losing money. Is valuation way higher than other comparable companies?
exactly,why fake it?
but I am feeling generous tonight, ask me anything
ya'll had me in the first half not gonna lie.
My bank account balance is at $69420
That was not the bottom imo. Not saying we are going to drop super hard any time soon but we have more to go I think. More pain before the market can start a new true bull market, the yields haven’t even re inverted yet.
99% chance of a recession by April 2024 at latest according to Conference Board indicator which has been very accurate. We might even be in one right now but I think a Q3 or Q4 start is more likely. Been studying the Fed and markets for over a decade.
It's valuation is 4.5 billion. Le Pain Quoditien which I think has the same amount of stores sold for 3 million in 2020. I don't see how this valuation is at least halved soon.

I don’t believe that
I understand. Try this article though so you get what the levels mean on whether they call it a bull or bear market. https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/sectors/sp500-stocks-reliably-jump-30-every-time-a-bear-market-ends/
ok 🤡🤡🤡 a recession with everyone screaming “stocks only go up”  very very recessionary indeed
Jesus! That’s fuckin crazy. Imma do 10 min of fact checking later this morning and I’m in. Will DM you to commiserate on this trade. You should know, my friend, every time (*literally every time*) I’ve longed options I lose.  So not sure you want me in on your side.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|29637)
dude it's all about your approach , you have to display confidence, smile and be down to earth, skyrocket being American white does not help you in this specific matter  find an ice breaker, let be a dance move, or a wink or anything that grabs their attention
[removed]
I know the technicalities I just trust bonds over everything. Technically is a bull market but based on history there is a zero percent chance it will be sustained without a lot more pain first.
I have 3500 on puts, 2 NVDA 375 for 9/15 and 2 QQQ 360 for 7/28. Fully expect the NVDAs to hit because of their ridiculous guidance up last earnings and insiders selling the rip hard. QQQ is more of a gamble but I’ll cut if it breaks above my level.
In 2008, during the deadcat bounce, the people who thought we were entering a recession were laughed at despite the data which was blatantly obvious
There are some trades that are just free money. One way to make it I feel like is just stay in cash and wait for the free money trades. This is one.
You got to be a bull and a bear to make it but never a pig. Most long trades are the way since it's a bull market but this is an exceptional against market trend trade that to me equals free money.
[deleted]
Lol you know how to inspect element
I definitely believe in a correction coming before January.
Nvda has been an amazing call to buy on any sell off. They have anointed it a trillion market cap. That price is around 408 I believe. So any sell off the short to medium calls at around 400 strike are usually hitting triples or quadruples. I see that to continue to work because it's a bull market and they have set its supposed to be a trillion cap.
but market is efficient and 100% right so ur point is wrong  everyone agrees nvda tsla aapl msft only goes up and they will all 10x in 5 years   idk what u trynna argue against tbh
Limit buy order is in and pending my friend.
I’m totally market agnostic. I have gone long options contracts only a handful of times, always lose. I mostly sell options, nearly always win.
Bro! Eat my ass, I'm on mobile
Same for you. You went from pivot-talk to recession to market efficiency/sentiment.
I think you'll do good man. I don't think you should que a limit order over night I think you wake up at 9:25 am and get ready to look for a chance in if you're excited as I was I pulled it off at 75 dollars a put and an hour later it was 100. That's still really low for the sell off coming imo.
Just letting you know I think longs are 99 percent of the good trades out there because it's a bull market for another couple years. This is just gonna be the pre ipo cava people dumping their profits and I think it'll dip below pre ipo pricing. I don't see there being any real demand for the stock or catalyst to push it higher for maybe over a couple years when they close in on profitability at which time I still don't think there will he much demand because we'll be entering a new bear market at that time.
Super quiet this week.  How do you like the new format? Anything you want to see changed?
All in on AZZ.  No clue what it is

TIL that revolving Sushi chain is actually a publicly traded company. Credit where credit is due, this thing rivals AAPL performance if you look back to its IPO price
What a boring week
Can someone call the SEC and get them to shut this week down?
Boring week
This is barely a week, half day today and no day tomorrow.

Most of us are too poor to eat at Wendy's, so calls on Albertsons

Kura means "The Dick" in my language. That's all the DD I need. Going balls deep on puts.
i know this isn't part of earnings, but mentioning things like FOMC could be awesome. honestly, any kind of major market catalyst.
I love you
Can you post it on Fridays ?
love it!
I like this one way more but there's not enough back of Wendys, cocaine, lambos and homeless elements to it
i love it
Be good to see the next few weeks of earnings rather than just the week we’re on

I like that shit. Thanks!
It’s sexy and cute
I like the new format.
Looks great OIP.  Only one suggestion for the next one if it is a template: On the ANITICIPATED in the upper left, I think there is a typo with a third I.   Thanks for keeping the sub running for everyone. While there may be only two I's in anticipated, there is no I in *'camp of degenerates'*
I love this!
Absolutely tits, good job
Great format, thanks a lot Opinion. I wish we had Average Move % and Options Implied Move % per play also on this report. Cheers![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|money_face)
Integrating events, as you started to do so above, that I otherwise need to look up separately, are a great addition and should continue
Keep it stickied till Friday imo
It looks like you took the Earning Whisper banner and just kinda... made it your own.  It's definitely nice to have this without a HUGE "Earning Whispers" watermark.   The only thing I'd add is just some numbers under each logo displaying the market cap or trading volume of each company.

Yo that place is bomb tho lmao
I think that is the place with conveyor belt sushi, and I heard they are planning on opening like a few hundred locations…. So actually might be interesting to track…
They have pretty fun robots that bring drinks around. Just wait til they announce those are loaded with the latest and greatest AI.
Hate to be that “well, actually” guy:  Kura sushi is a cheap sushi chain restaurant in Japan. People can get plates of sushi for almost a dollar compared to whatever crazy prices you’re paying stateside. There was an incident a A few months ago where teenagers were recording themselves missing with the condiment tray and eating other peoples sushi on the conveyor belt. This caused a panic and a steep drop in price for the Japanese stock. American stock seems unaffected and just rolls with whatever the NASDAQ and SPY are doing.   Pulling back on the chart it seems it’s close to its all time high. Not sure if it’s expecting to jump or not after earnings report.  I’m thinking it may go down.  Thoughts?
lol

I’m thinking of calls but still holding on to rivn c’s and need to research
On one hand, I like being off work.  On the other, the four day trading weeks make it hard to get my gambling fix.
low IV
Yep, this ![img](emote|t5_2th52|27189)
FOMC has been ear marked, CPI release dates, jobless claims/labor statistics, any other market catalysts you can think of?
Yup!
Did you see the details in the binocular reflection?
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)
Yes like a monthly snapshot on the first of the month in addition to this
AI renames all sizes to the size you were in high school.. still fits!
I know I live in Japan
Yeah there was an article a couple weeks ago which said that based on how Kura performs it may encourage some of the large well known international brands like Gyu-kaku, Gen, and Nando's to go public too.
#hi 🦦
And they have a lot of competition. Other sushi chains give the same service at similar prices.
If Shake Shake can be, why not them?

yeah, but try buying crypto and you suddenly need a rectum xray signed by the pope to buy $10 of Bitcoin
This is absolutely correct.    Mine had me fill out an approval questionnaire.  On it, I was asked my level of experience trading (none) and my purpose in trading (speculation).  Within minutes it popped back congratulations you have been assigned Level 3 options on your account.  Then a bit later, in email from them, they are advertising/suggesting I look into converting to a margin account.  These brokerages have no shame in what they sell and to whom they are selling.
That’s me performing DD before going all in on my portfolio

Yeah, people lose huge amounts of money with options because they are being stupid. But it is wrong to gatekeep people from options trading because there is also lots of money to be made. Not people in this sub ofcourse but in general.

enh mine made me pass their options quiz.  Surprised how well I did, considered they asked a lot of questions about shit I had to speculate the meaning of.  But... I guess thats what Im here to do.  Speculate.
Will someone educate me on the various level of options and which (if any) don’t require margin?
Actor Rip Torn back from the dead and slumming it?
what would the market be without dumb money?
i have never applied for level 4, i think that's the best decision i've ever made, well, i guess
Anyone try crypto options?
What would happen if someone goes all in on margin and just gives up?  Like yolo and end up $250k in debt?  Declare bankruptcy and not have to pay it back?  Honestly it seems like a win-win. I have about $50k in my savings and nothing for them to come after for. Either I make a few million or my living situation stays exactly the same?

That’s a whole other level of random risk and other shenanigans.
But if they don't do that then how are you supposed to get the experience if they won't give you the trading permissions?
You cannot tell them the truth, though, or they won't give you access. I told Fidelity I wanted to gamble away all of my money on short term options with zero trading experience and my actual yearly income and they told me no.  *Then* I reapplied 30 minutes later and told them I had been trading for 100 years and make 100B annually and they gave me level 2 options and suggested I consider trading on margin.
you cant have level 3 without margin.  So stop embellishing
You would have had to have margin for lvl 3 options anyways.
It was a bitch to get level four options for me.
Dang I can't even get Robinhood to give me options lol
Tbf that's what I want from a broker. We can't want to be degenerates and then complain when people let us.
Brokerages are often open client discretionary trading accounts. They’re selling the service behind the scenes. You’re choosing what to buy/sell. I always felt people should be allowed to trade and take whatever risk they want. If they don’t “get it” then shouldn’t do it.
I filled out the questionnaire, it said "sorry, but level 2 is best for you", so I just went back and refilled out the questionnaire to unlock the full tiers. What a joke.
Then I reapplied 30 minutes later and told them I had been trading for 100 years and make 100B
> These brokerages have no shame in what they sell and to whom they are selling.  Why should they? There are no legal repercussions for the current practices. Regulation is required to actually make a difference and we know the finance bros are notorious for being anti-regulation, even when it would be beneficial and protect people who are at the most risk of losing everything due to lack of experience & education.
Damn I just assumed I would have to lie and lied

That's a good one
Yeah but they don't allow naked selling. So for them there is no risk.
Or just lie to them, they don't give a fuck.
Tell them you promise you'll do a good job with your wife's boyfriend's money. 100% guarantee to get options.
Yeah they do the full cavity.
Right? I worked in finance for a BD (on the IB side though) and they didn't approve me at all when I tried.

Don't tell them you live out of the Wendy's dumpster though
It was a bitch to get level four options for me. Took like four times of submitting proof of income and worth. Had to just call them to figure out what they wanted instead of going in circles.
How did you get it approved? The minimum requirements seem absurdly high.
Isn’t that just on you at this point.  I mean, your the one that let it go to 0.

I mean he's not even half assing. This is 1/4 assing at best. Gotta at least half ass ur job.

The checks are there because the government wants to scare people away from using bitcoin to buy drugs on the darkweb. No one cares if you go into crippling debt due to risky investments.
>how are you supposed to get the experience if they won't give you the trading permissions?  You get it from regards behind Wendy's whom margin called
Whiney baby can't handle playing fair in a market
Don’t you need margin for any options trading?
Ah this is correct.  I just checked my account.  It doesn't directly say which tier but from the descriptions it appears I have Tier 2 and they are recommending I apply for Tier 3.
How do you even get level 4? I’m 3
I'm curious was there an account value required for level four?  I don't want to sell naked stuff often but I am looking at weekly straddles
dude, what?  how does it feel to be the most regarded of all?
I see it more like a bar.  You can walk in and buy whatever drink you like but can also get in over your head.  The bartender needs to know when to cut you off.
Which brokerage? Did you redo the questionnaire that same day?
People in here constantly complain about PDT which was implemented to save the daytraders from themselves and you want brokers to actually enforce the asset/experience requirements for options?  There'd be a riot lmao.
AI large scale market analysis in a nutshell.
Either you meet them or you don’t. They have a person who verifies each one so you can’t just claim it. Need to prove it, and they don’t just pass you through. My employer did not match since I changed jobs since opening my brokerage. They noticed and and denied me for that. Got it fixed and approved, but they look.
I'm pretty sure the system is rigged against me specifically. Why else would I be losing money?
I've read about studies that found ~60% of people are incompetent at their job.  My incompetent analysis is therefore that you need to 40% ass it to meet expectations.
He has to touch half your ass?
your broker cares, that's why they restricted purchases of meme stocks because they know retail would lose their ass and end up trading less earning broker less money
No, I only trade at options lvl 1, I only sell covered calls and puts. Although there have been a few times where it would have been nice to have some margin.
You do need it if you want to take naked positions.
Cash accounts can trade naked options allday
You have to kill Warmock in the Ice Dungeon first.
Haha. Good analogy.   Unfortunately what you’re looking for is an advisory account when the advisor buys/sells stuff for you. It’s like going to a speakeasy and the bartender makes you a cocktail after asking you a few questions. He’ll cut you off too because the advisor knows you.   The brokerage platform is more like a self serve ticket redeemed tap style bar. No bar tender. As long as you ‘scan your ticket’ (pay) you can keep drinking.
Reddit is not a typical trader, let them riot.
How can I trust the study if the people conducting it were likely incompetent
If my broker cared they wouldn't let me trade naked options on a school teachers salary lol
Oh, never dealt with level one and two options. Did not know that. Just assumed you needed margin even if you did not use it.
If you saw my comment before I deleted it, I read your wrong.   Level three is not naked but still need margin.
[deleted]
? How do you sell a naked call on a cash account?
>The brokerage platform is more like a self serve ticket redeemed tap style bar. No bar tender. As long as you ‘scan your ticket’ (pay) you can keep drinking.  Yes, this is how it is.  I'm saying I think the bartender scenario is how it should be.  The whole point of the approval process is to mitigate risk.  But it seems brokerage don't care as much about that these days.  Hence the air pat down meme.  They pretend they screened new account holders, but really they're not.  I think they should go one step further and reduce privis once an account holder has taken too many hits in a given timeframe.  At best it seems they will suggest video lessons on trading.  But as long as you can order, you're getting that next drink -- even if you're becoming a fish.  And this sub's loss gore really tells the tale of how that's going.  haha
Better only 24% ass it just to be sure.
They make the most off of those commissions compared to stocks
Definitely not. My E-Trade account has options but I don't trust myself enough to enable margin. I'm comfortable knowing the absolute worst I can do is 100% wipe out my current balance. No going negative and owing 700k or something crazy like I read about in this sub.
Depends on the platform, Schwab does 0-3, so 3 is naked there. Margin auto included on 2-3 on Schwab as well.
you need margin for spread trading as well.  and non cash covered put sales.  and obviously naked calls.
That’s what I was thinking as well. I think he means you don’t use the margin, but you need to have a margin account. I don’t know though.
FINRA/SEC already made things difficult as is (I’m in the business). At least it’s better than Vegas where they only check your age. Good luck.
Its a nice thing to have, honestly, just don't sell naked puts/calls and you'll be fine. But there have a been a couple times where I was like man I wish I had enabled margin or just kept more cash in my account.  An example of this was right before Hindenburg targeted IEP. For whatever reason I was feeling/premonition like IEP was a yield trap, and I wanted to buy some deep OTM(like 10-15$ OTM) puts to hedge myself incase something happened, but all my extra cash was in money market fund, I only needed like 100$ of margin, by the time my money cleared from the money market, it was too late and Hindenburg had struck, and I'm still holding the bag on IEP, just slowly writing calls to claw back out.
Unfortunately you need margin enabled to sell spreads. I wish I could disable it because I don't fully understand how the margin requirements are calculated.
Considering the nonchalance of the approval process, I'd say it is just going through the motions so they can say they were pro-active.  There could be so much more they could do, but I know they won't because there is no morality or care on wall street only money making.  Take care!
Selling naked is fine. Just so long as you are comfortable with the risk and know how to manage the trade if it goes against you.   All I do is naked and it has worked out great for me so far.
You cannot buy options on margin
Everything I used to do was naked until the flashing lights came and some angry men started yelling about indecent exposure.
Good to know, ty. I still don't have margin on my account, I still only write covered.
Like I said; you got to know what to do if things go against you.   I usually just pull the uno reverse card and they never know what to do. Works like a charm. Always have to have your own flashing lights as well.
Looks like someone forgot stocks only go up.

Ehhh... This isn't new.   It's been going on for **YEARS** by now.  But I **do** wonder when the limit will eventually be breached and the whole system comes crashing down...... Some years? a Decade?? Or can the can kicking be sustained even longer perhaps?  Only time will tell...
What are the alternative currencies that will take down the USD? The Yuan cannot bc China is a creditor country reliant on exports and, as such, has a vested interest in manipulating the Yuan's value to further its domestic goals. No outside country will want to rely on the Yuan when its value is subject to change at a moment's notice. A prerequisite to being the reserve currency is that the country whose currency it is **cannot** care about its value day to day.   The Euro cannot because the countries that make up the Eurozone have diametrically opposed geopolitical and economic goals to the extent that not even the Eurozone can agree on using the Euro as a medium of exchange.  The Yen? The japanese economy has been stagnated since the mid to late 80s and their demographics are some of the worst in the world.  Bitcorn? Do we really need to argue this one?  Maybe some sort of CBDC, but you'll have to have that in existence before I take it seriously.  A lot of headwinds could (and are)hitting the world and US economies, but a devaluation of the dollar is not one of them. For fuckssake pull up a 25 yr chart of DXY and tell me the dollar isn't at an above average valuation.  This is a post by a regard who is looking for a reason to be bearish and eventually fabricated one to make a meme out of.
There is no bubble and inflation rates are way down. Is this old? Feels old.
Us: We need to fix inflation.  Fed: I'll raise interest rates.  Us: oh interesting...the regional banks are starting to fail.  Fed: I got this! [Pulls out money printer]  Us: Um... Who's going to tell him?
Yes. This.
As long as the U.S. has it's sweet sweet overly funded and inflated military by its side, there will be no financial collapse.  I've been hearing about this impending collapse throughout my teens and into my entire adult life.  It has yet to happen and I fail to see how it will outside of thermonuclear war.  Even then, we'll still probably be the world's reserve currency.
Basically how I’ve been feeling all 2023, my portfolio is way up but I know all of this shit is a scam.
This is cocaine.
**Facts cease to exist if you refuse to acknowledge them.**  OP playing with fire. Now he has to "be cautious" and "act responsibly". Fucking regard

Ngl this is one of my reasons I try to avoid debt (I do currently have some, but I’m working on paying it off)  In the event of a major financial crash, I have significantly less bills to pay and in theory I could go back to working some easy to get job that pays poorly and it’d suck, but I’d be okay
Treasury haven't printed shit since 2021
It's OK once you realize that inflation has nothing to do with the money supply you will transcend these concerns.
Well, you could also put a part of your portfolio into Bitcoin which is probably going to thrive if/when the inevitable collapse of the financial system comes.

He's right!  I wish putin and the greedy oil executives would stop being so mean.  And yeah, those banks were suffering from issues that the big banks aren't, everyone knows the big banks are too big to fail. Duh.  About inflation - hell yeah! It's only 4% guys, cmon. Remember when our cost of living quadroupled? Well now its only twice as bad as before - and JPow is making the landing extra soft. It's so funny when they say we have a bad economy cause we created too many jobs... don't they know that jobs are good lmfao  We're going to the fucking moon baby, lock n load! Who's with me?!

Nice. What if hypothetically I'm stuck in a decent paying job that I don't really like, but I stay just to pay the bills because my personal financial responsibility it's shit and I need to pay the credit cards and keep the family happy with their  way of living and I could move up but don't want to.
Thats called being a normie
Ambition Level: 0
That’s wocel
Nah a pushover..
In my career, seniority determines how good of a job/schedule you have. If I promote, I go to the bottom of seniority, which would mean bad job and schedule and only a 5% raise. I can easily make that difference in pay with one 8 hour overtime shift.
Ew, union or gov work? It was mostly just bantz because you asked for a title. Everyone has their own level of bullshit tolerance, and it sounds like your "promotion" would exceed even mine. Only 5% for a worse schedule and responsibilities you don't want/like? No thanks, not unless it becomes exponentially more lucrative in the future.
Government union work
The double whammy, lol. When I was in the Navy, we idolized the pier electricians for their pay/schedule setup. Turns out someone has to (sometimes literally) die for you to move up into the more cushy roles. Still not the worst gig if you found your niche and knew how to work it. At least you're essentially unfireable. That peace of mind is worth quite a lot.
Sell the news
Zuck: "If Elon won't fight me in the ring, I'll fight him this way"
This app is made by the Instagram team so expect to see a ton of influencers joining this app to boost their engagement on Instagram too.
I’m tempted to buy Meta tomorrow and ride the hype this week. I think the timing of Threads being released and the rate limits at Twitter is good for Meta - hopefully will convert more users to try Threads.
Threads is actually a pretty good name.
It’s been a long time since FB did something good.  Let them fight.
Calls  Edit: love seeing billionaires fighting
Meta is going for the jugular. Mark is going to incapacitate Elon while meta takes over twitter’s business.
Same policies as IG good luck with that
meta line go uppies?
This app will not be available in EU as it tries to download every single piece of information about you down to the number of shits you’ve taken today.  Also for all twitters flaws why would I want a copy cat version controlled by Zuckerberg lol.
Maybe we will see they Elon zuck fight after all!
This is going to be DOA when it doesn't allow porn
Twitter is a dumpster fire. My feed is all fight videos and other crazy shit. Instagram team will probably do really well with this. Plus the recent post limit cuts or whatever on twitter.
I’ll join just to help screw Twitter
Never even heard of Threads lol
This will be just as trash as Facebook  Twitter isn't an influencer or social media app really   It's a news app for most people and a developing story follow-along tool  This doesn't even mention that this is completely DoA because Meta will likely police content heavily, and one of the biggest draws of Twitter is it's pretty much the only mainstream social media that is entirely uncensored. Shit, I know like 3 people personally who go to Twitter literally just to see fucked up uncensored war videos  Just as trash as everything else Meta is  So calls it is  META 7/14 300c
Earnings gonna shoot through the roof on the 26th
I can see Facebook, Instagram, Threads and WhatsApp becoming the X app. Not sure I can see Twitter growing into that…
DOA
Any app will kill Twatter if user can say what ever message/ upload and share without getting ban by fkn idiots work in the company..
They also go all in on collecting your data.
I rather contract an incurable disease then be a part of any new meta social media
Lame
The key to success will be how they will integrate the woke culture in to it.
Facebook...
 Bogus app.  Meta/Zuckerberg  will just ban, silence, all the Republican viewpoint perspectives, again. Somehow, some way, they will find a clause to ban your account if you are on the opposite end of Blue.
Oh look. Another original idea by Zuck. I bet Elon’s really scared
Twitter is a wasteland. It is time for something new. I will be looking forward to this
Of course all the Governments need an Open platform where they can track you all the time, and Twitter is getting out of their control  Meta app will die like masta whatever and truth social etc
Elon is killing all the ai thread scrapers  That them report and delete info That the gov doesn't want getting out  I was pissed at first but after realizing what elon did  I'm glad he did
Twitter killed itself long time ago no need for this lmao
Threads an Instagram App by Meta fka Facebook aka The Facebook
I hoped they would name it Thotter - a more fitting name
An instagram app cus it sounds better than Facebook lmao
Facebook is boomer bullshit ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Just like they went all in on the metaverse?
More like meta killer
Regulate social media! Just as harmful as cigarettes or alcohol but almost entirely without oversight
Twitter killer? More like a bird with a water gun! 🐦💦
The Apple Store shows what data is collected by the app, it’s basically anything and everything available (apparently FB and Insta are the same).
Hear me out, for the first time ever Zuck has given himself a handicap. No way Twitter was gonna work, the only way it works is by beefing and proving they are better oriented for news orgs etc.. So Elon baits Zuck and if this move fails it may have finally happened that the Zuck gets cucked! Twitter has nothing to prove here, that bar is on the floor! Any thing short of success and boom! 💥
Their last all in did not end good
Apparently the Meta electric car is not far from announcement also.
Shhh. Don’t tell them the secret.
sell the organs
"Let them fight" meme
Oh god. Not the “influencers.”
So, regular social media.
Yea. It’s quite telling that none of the screen captures used to advertise Threads on the App Store make any mention of news/current affairs. It’s literally a lady gushing about how she discovered a cool new coffee shop… and another lady sharing her opinion about it.  So far, I’m unconvinced Meta is even trying to turn Threads into the next Twitter because it’s really not.
An app solely exist to allow self absorbed jerks to brag about their lavish life over other peasants now want people to share how superior they are by words? Yeah DOA.
It's going to go as good as the metaverse.
They need people that do breaking news to convert. Curious if they will bring over/sponsor people in Sports, News, Pop culture over.
If twitter barely makes a profit (based on elon's own complaints), how much revenue will an app stealing their users really net?
[deleted]
Name a successful app with name beginning with a dental fricative.
Explain
10 years ago it would have been named Thredy or Thrdss
Except that it evokes the name of a movie which [terrified an entire generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threads_(1984_film\)).
Lol you're kidding right?
I think people are done with Meta. Look at the metaverse...threads seem desperate. Noone wants to give that company more info.  https://preview.redd.it/njv9r5xmp2ab1.jpeg?width=1100&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=bf8d975cddc634d1c32122f57effe4f591d6d04f
Yet somehow instagram and facebook are available in EU.
Doesn’t stop the only fans idiots on instagram
If you go on IG and type in the word threads, you’ll see an advertisement for Zuck’s direct competitor to Twitter
What do you mean by X app?
Lmao please tell me who is being silenced because I hear all those losers crying about it every day
Show us on the doll where Zuckerberg touched you
If people like you don’t exist, exit liquidity won’t be a thing .

Actually, maybe not scared, but his $45 billy or whatever spent on buying Twitter is going to look a LOT worse. It could MySpace Twitter.  No horse in this race, I’m just here for the memes.
Considering the shitshow going on @ twitter.... he might.
One of those companies is massively profitable. The other is Twitter.
Proof that there’s ALWAYS a sucker.      “AI thread scrapers”….. smh, holy hell.
Interesting can you show an instance? Or further reading for this. Thanks!
Problem is, there is no substitute for twitter, and nothing to fill the gap
Finally they gonna do something useful like. Boost my meta calls
damn b, sell me that gold beauty of an avatar you're holding, whew.
Can we put them in a submarine? ^^too ^^soon?
🤢
You just described 99% of social media.  You also just described this subreddit.  Hard to call it DOA when it's something that just keeps working over and over again.
Whatever we can do to stick it to Elon for being a centrist despite doing more for green projects than 99.999999% of people. Zuck can gladly take all my information and sell it through yet another app.
It’s a proven concept though, unlike metaverse. All they have to do is be less socially regarded than musk and his team of junior developers, which should be pretty straightforward
The way reels blew up I wouldn’t count it out
Meta already has a advertisement unit so opening it up to a new app would be easier than creating one from scratch. Also Elon drove away advertisers so that was his own doing
Who do you think is better at generating ad revenue? Twitter who knows nothing about their customers, users, etc or facebook who knows who you were dating 3 years ago, who you were working for, how much money you make, who everyone in your family is, who you voted for...  The value of the traffic going to meta would be much higher than the value of the exact same traffic going to twitter.
Twitter is turning into truth social based on stuff recommended to my feed
Are you new here? Lol.
Twitter never has, and never will make a penny  17 years without doing so, they won't start today
1. Meta doesn’t need threads to be profitable on its own as a unit.  Just like WhatsApp it can be a great source for data in order to serve ads on fb and insta.  2. From the other pov - thanks to the data from their other platforms they will be able to serve ads on Threads a lot better than Twitter can, plus they already a huge userbase of advertisers who will just have new ad formats now.  Very few advertisers bother to have an ads account on Twitter because it’s sucks for advertisers, but almost every company on earth with a marketing budget advertises on meta.
Lmao Elon bans anyone that shit talks him
Elon has been banning people who talk mean to him for a long time now.   Aaron Greenspan is just the latest.
The guy above you posted.   .      You responded.   .           I responded to you.   That is a thread.
Agreed
>Look at the metaverse...  What metaverse? They've been saying time and time again that it's something they are building, not something that is built, but people keep throwing this word around like its been around for a decade. Also I am looking and the Quest 3 that's about to release this autumn looks pretty sweet
Metaverse is going to be big in the commercial market. It's an easier and cheaper way to train people over long distances.
I’m sure they’ll launch eventually after they meet the regulatory issues. They’re launching in UK who no longer have standards.
Haha.  Dude is so delusional
[removed]
Depends on who joins this app and how well it can fill the role twitter has currently
We already tried that. The sub was so full of hot air that it would just keep breaching the surface.
Idk where else to talk about it but I predicted this to my friends nearly 10 years ago when I was frustrated with facebook pushing videos HARD. There was no real 'algorithm' as we know it today, so it was basically facebook showing you shit that your friends interacted with.      I wanted to see two things: photos my friends took, and status updates my friends posted.      Instagram has that shit down to a T. I don't use twitter, but I'm hoping this threads thing takes care of the status updates.
Not even one social media is even close to Instagram.
1) Elon is not a Centrist. Not by a country mile. 2) Not certain he’s done really anything for green projects outside of making Marijuana references. He did not create or found Tesla, which would have been the only claim to that effect I’m aware of. To that end his involvement has become synonymous with quality degradation in service of cost cutting.  Are you referring to anything specific outside of Tesla?
You're a 🤡   Elon was a leftist when he was getting all that sweet free green government money.  Then he switched to being far-right because they're the easiest to grift.  He was never and had never been a "centrist"    Unless you're misspelling opportunist.

I wouldn’t say reels is anything more than an lesser alternative to tik tok. There’s not many reels centered creators that aren’t also on Tik tok. I’m not saying reels isn’t valuable in its own right. But I don’t think it would kill Twitter. Granted Twitter isn’t doing the best right now but it wouldn’t say it’s near death.
And meta can guarantee the stability of management, like Instagram and Facebook.  Assuming Threads can build a user base, grow and maintain that engagement, offering the reasons why people would go to twitter, Threads would succeed if they can do the same thing but better, without it being a circus every week, and with better cross platform sharing.   It’s just up to the users. Many companies build clone apps that never take, but sometimes things could work out.
I was linked a twitter post and I started scrolling and an elon tweet popped up of him sharing a tucker carlson post.      Come on bro, no one wants to see your shit.
They make more than a penny right now
Fb mods really suck though. You say something even remotely critical of someone else, say, you’re critiquing a photo… BANNED. Bunch of overzealous douchebags run those groups.
I’m aware of what a thread is. But Twitter isn’t thread style like Reddit is.  Also what’s the verb going to be. Thread it ?  He threaded it?  He posted a thread ?   He tweeted. His tweet said.   That works better
That will be fun to use in the metaverse ![img](emote|t5_2th52|31249)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
So is Google meet.
Tesla cars and service did get better before they got worse.  The founders left well before the model 3.  Elon is entirely responsible for mainstreaming EVs.   I’m not sure why he went full right wing douche after that.
Sorry lost you after the hackneyed and regarded clown emoji.
I know it didn’t take out tik tok but it’s certainly not a ghost town.  Twitter is absolutely toxic. It’s way worse to be actually creating a cesspool versus just hosting a cesspool if you understand what I’m saying.
The thing is people on twitter are there because facebook is trash, and the meta and facebook names are total poison to that userbase, ive already seen tweets saying "not this one" about Threads. This going to be shut down within 3 years unless something extreme happens.
I agree. I love the timing of a Twitter competitor from Meta, but “Threads” is an uninspiring name, and really missing the verb form to describe using it.
If by "metaverse" you mean a plethora of apps and games on their platform + PCVR, then yeah, it will definitely be fun. While we also on this topic, you said that "people are done with meta" and then went straight for the "metaverse".. Please check the monthly active users count of fb and ig and short the stock, I dare you
Lmaooo right wing
I agree with that, my main point is most of the content is created from tik tok just ported over to reels. If tik tok for some reason didn’t allow their content to be on other  platforms reels would die within a few months maybe a year
You’re not wrong. All great points and I agree with all, my only standout point from my post would be for those who are kind of tired of the twitter shenanigans, post limits, feature changes, I feel like the app is unpredictable at this point and it’s future is uncertain. Musk said it’s brand will become X and be a super app. What does that mean for me as a twitter user and the community I am a part of, I don’t know. If anyone’s on the fence or is looking to check Threads out and the app has staying power, it’ll stick around for longer than an experiment cycle, but if it still has that poison maybe it’s axed. As bad as it is, I still know people that use Facebook and Instagram.
People are on Twitter because of who else is on Twitter so if the influencers move everyone else will. God alone knows if it’ll work
Instagram isn’t poison tho
Should’ve just called it Bleat. We’re all just cattle anyway in their eyes.
Haha I'll buy a couple puts for funzies. Everyone and their mother has a FB doesn't mean they are on it. Their advertising rev has been declining and TikTok has eaten their lunch. Active user defined as the preinstalled app that you don't look at sent you a notification...ok. metaverse has been a dumpster fire of money. I bought a couple of those Oculus units for my nephews. They used it for a little while but now it's just something they have on the self. Not enough games that are good to keep them playing they said. Pcvr is another thing. Decent set up for 400 but still. Treads is a desperate attempt to stay relevant. Maybe it will work maybe it won't. I don't think it will, but hey, enjoy your oculus thing.
Double down and close your eyes 👍🏼

Ah I see. I missed out on the NVDA jump the day before as well.
is it inflation adjusted tho?
All of my materials needed to build docks per code are sitting basically at ATH, covid fucked materials all to hell and we all are paying the price.

Things don’t go straight up forever😂😂. The more dramatic the up, the more dramatic the down. To put in terms you can understand.
That's why nvidia has a PE ratio of 200+
Yeah. Master electrician and independent electrical contractor here. I wired a ~75 square foot kitchen a few weeks ago and materials for the entirety of the job were $1600 alone. I pass the buck to the customer. I definitely don't eat it. I done upcharge my materials at all. I charge my customers the same cost I get the materials for, but as a result my prices have definitely increased. I see this as the most inflated aspect to the market right now. Groceries aren't *as* bad this year in comparison, but construction supplies are still heinous
I work construction and can tell you that currently there is jack shit after december.

Why are we posting old news
Because a shit storm is always right around the corner.
The saying is that the end of real estate cycle you can’t build it fast enough. Looks like the FOMO is strong
“How can you be a bear?”  So there are two main contributors to which way the economy will go.  And they are both related to money.   On the one hand, there is a ton of cash sitting on the sidelines waiting to be spent or invested.   On the other hand, money supply is decreasing.   Which one wins out?  It’s really hard to say. But I’m going to speculate that initially cash on sidelines will be the driver up, and that declining money supply will be an issue later once this cash has been committed.
When you consider all the profit from this growth is going to the .5% you have to know it will come down. Also if you didn't know the current annual wage in the US is $33k, in adjusted dollars the wage during the Great Depression was $88k. We are royally fucked, war, famine and illness is over the horizon (aka the great reset)
When you pass 1.7 billion infrastructure bill anything is possible
I am slightly bearish only because I am seeing an uptick in layoff related stuff
Unions are asking for more and material is still not as easy to get.
That chart looks like a overextended move. I'll usually short on a weekly candle to the downside.

Because chickens always come home to the roost
Lmao spending up but manufacturing at like a 20 year low LOL. Most of these projects are just money laundering schemes that end up half complete and never employee anyone. Even the ones that do are unsustainable without billlions of FED infusions annually. But the contractors make 100s of billions.
Bears are delusional
It's not a choice, they're born that way.
It’s an increase of $100M in an economy of $25T. What does that come to?? I’m too lazy to get my calculator.   I’m guessing it’s less than 0.001% of GDP? Don’t get so excited.
It spiked during 2008 and 2009 to
Spend while you still can, soon the money wont be worth anything  🤷
Psychologically most people in Finance have libertarian or conservative leanings and they want the economy to falter under Democratic Presidents. I believe the deficit and economic growth since the 1950s don't correlate to Republicans being better on the economy but many believe they are so it's a mindset thing mostly
Being a bear takes true resilience, and a love for hibernation!
What year is it?  When I looked at this graph I was in total disbelief that it's 2023. Inflation is over???
Well for all you bleeding heart environmentalists..  I beseech you to go work a few day labor jobs.. the sheer amount of wood other materials that get thrown away is staggering lol... that's how you raise housing prices. Let alone construction spending lol. Could 1000% make a whole other 10 unit apartment building with the material they throw away on three buildings. In Austin anyways.
Construction spending at all time high since prices of material and labor are at all time highs.
This is important especially cause it cost us 9 trillion in the build back better bill
Check commercial construction loan interest.
Mainly because Biden and Democrats went on a spending spree passing trillions in unnecessary spending over the last 2 1/2 years.  Also the reason inflation was at 40 year highs.  Any president or political party can pass trillions in new spending and boost manufacturing, it’s not rocket science.  The problem comes on the other side when the taxpayers have to pay for it and when inflation blows up.    Check back in 2 years and see what the aftermath of all this spending and high inflation does to the current economy.
Oh no we have peaked
Easy, just wear a bear costume and growl confidently! 🐻
Just because someone is bearish about n a specific stock doesn’t mean they’re not bullish on the American Economy. Contrary to popular perception of the stock market always going up, there will always be companies that go out of business and they definitely outnumber the ones that become profitable. Just like anything in this world the cream of the crop always rises to the top and there’s always the majority that fail.
Must’ve been on orange barrels because all I see is that and no workers

The current administration's commitment to bringing these computer manufacturing industries home is one of the most important initiatives that doesn't get talked about enough. Incredibly important stuff.
It's from the combination of the inflation reduction act and chips act creating huge government backed demand to build Chip fabrication plants, battery plants, renewable energy plants, carbon capture, etc... and all the factories to supply said plants in combination with a lot of manufacturing fleeing China out of fear of authoritarian unpredictability and an invasion of Taiwan within 5 years.   This shouldn't be that shocking if one paid attention to the project announcements in the past 2 years.  Now if only we could do the same with housing...
Yes. This is real spending

Very clearly not
Isn’t this just showing construction for manufacturing so construction of like factories?   I think it’s due to congress throwing money at manufacturing like the CHIPS act or whatever it was. Otherwise we wouldn’t see this increase in manufacturing construction.   I’m sure suppliers are enjoying all that free money from Uncle Sam. They can raise prices for commercial materials, and manufactures have no intentions of making their products cheaper because of it.   Still probably a good decision from a national standpoint for certain industries like chips to be brought home.   I’d assume overall or commercial construction spending is a similar chart though.
Had a neighbor who had the change the color of the house they were building based on what scraps were available…. Interesting times
It is very nice how you mock your clients who provide you with an income.  You won't be so cocky if the construction work dries up next year, so appreciate your wealthy clients while you have them.

If you look at listings now it’s clearly visible which home flippers/remodelers fucked up on the financials with. Property tax is very high where I live, so if a builder is done with the house they want it gone as soon as possible, no reason to hold it for long and hope the right buyer shows up. I see a few that were total gut remodels where they needed to do the roof and windows (or they at least decided to do it) and these things cost a LOT of money but don’t always help the resell value as much as other upgrades. So you have this area with $500k homes and they’re asking $650k for it because they bought it for $450k and insane material costs rose up the costs.
Prolly 2022 article 🤣
Yeah buddy this is manufacturing spend not real estate
What evidence do you have for that? Lots of prevailing wage and union provisions in the IRA for one example. Wage increases are real
Dude I worked in a factory building houses. Like trailer park homes. You wouldn't believe the amount of copper wire that goes into the trash. The waste was incredible. Anyway. 3 months ago, 21 houses a day 5 days a week. Now? 14 a day, four days a week.
Uhh, Build Back Better never passed.  Also it wasn't 9 trillion.  This is part of the CHIPS and Science Act, which is only 280 billion, and only half of that is going to manufacturing.
The regard in this one is strong.

Then what's the excuse for insurance increases?
Exactly… it doesn’t matter if this manufacturing ever producing a single product the GDP growth is booked on day 1 when they pay the contractors 100s of billions. Now that’s revenue according to the gov and allows them to print trillions more.
> I think it’s due to congress throwing money at manufacturing like the CHIPS act or whatever it was. Otherwise we wouldn’t see this increase in manufacturing construction.  basically, this.  chips act and the inflation incre...err, reduction act.  it's monumentally stupid, especially in a period of high inflation.  especially with the central bank trying to lower inflation... but c'est la vie.  >Still probably a good decision from a national standpoint for certain industries like chips to be brought home.   eh, no.  it never 'left,' it's just that the domestic fabs suck.  giving them money isn't going to make them suck less.  they'll just be sucking and wasting taxpayer money.  it's not like tsmc/etc developed the best fabs accidentally.
Amen.  Deal with it everyday.  Sucks most of the time due to the restrictions not even making sense.  It all comes down to the counties getting their cut outta you via fees and fines.  Currently building a 140ft fishing pier where the guy just flat paid the fine for having about an acre of mangroves removed.  A cool 145k fine.    I asked him what he thought of that.  (In the sense that the fine was large enough to prevent it and it shouldn’t have happened).  He smirked and said the cost was worth it for his vision…  His dock is going to run him 80 probably

read the title I know you think everything is a picture book
Oh right, construction was my regarded word in the title. I think I get it now.. it’s moving manufacturing  domestic? Well of course it should keep growing like a skyscraper, almost nothing has been made domestic since forever. Chart looks neat but it doesn’t tell us anything except costs are rocketing. Need to see the corresponding foreign investment charts. Which I’d assume look like a landing glider
not \*computer\*, batteries are also counted as "electrical".
Me as a rising sophomore in computer engineering seeing all these facilities coming online as I graduate: 😁
The Dark Brandon timeline is surprisingly bright.
It is real spending   https://home.treasury.gov/news/featured-stories/unpacking-the-boom-in-us-construction-of-manufacturing-facilities#ftn1
No one buying what? Do you think they’re just building factories for a tax write off?
I bought
Good thing TSMC is building a domestic fab currently
The administration is attacking supply side of inflation and all people do is complain. So boring.
It’s not a fine it’s mitigation and he’s paying a  mitigation bank. Florida doesn’t let you destroy wetlands or mangroves like that without replacing them somewhere else so he probably paid that 145k fine to a mitigation bank unless he did it illegally and they fined him for it.
I mean that’s perfectly reasonable to do if the guy destroyed an acre of wetlands.  They should have just not allowed him to build there in their first place.

Insourcing has been very big recently. Basically the opposite of outsourcing. The pandemic showed the world that you can’t really be reliant on other nations to build whatever you need to run your business. Like imagine if Apple couldn’t build iPhones to sell, they basically wouldn’t have a company anymore. So a lot of these companies are reworking their manufacturing strategies.
I'd assume power generation aka solar may also be considered electrical.
GPT-5 will do the computer engineering and you'll be working with your mouth behind Wendy's
Dark Brandon has been consistently injecting the market with Shrek cum and I'm all for it
You’re confusing different datasets. Look at the source at the bottom of OP’s screenshot. The data comes from the US Census Bureau’s monthly construction spending data. That survey is not deflated, it is nominal construction spending.   https://www.census.gov/construction/c30/c30index.html
Yeah bro you just write it off
IDK stocks have never been known to go up or down
Yeah I’d you saw how many fully built Wharehouse/offices are empty by me you would be worried.  Brands new buildings all over the place and no one occupying them.
In my area they are building warehouses with no tenants signed. 🙃
[deleted]
yes, actually.
...which has already had a buttload of problems (and the costs are already WAYYY higher than they anticipated) and which tsmc just had to ship over engineers.  last week.  that's the point.  tsmc's fabs in taiwan are a profitable powerhouse.  their fabs here?  they'll be lucky if they return profit.
the supply side when?  2025+?  and ffs, it's way more expensive to fab in the usa versus taiwan, s korea, etc, so... no, it's not attacking any side of inflation, it's (very) inflationary.  derp
*illegally*
“Only up.”
It probably didn’t help…
I am not sure, I think it is not considered "manufacturing".
It doesn’t matter. Even if this chart isn’t deflated, deflating it doesn’t change the story.

Stonks, on the other hand…
It’s amazing how many people just believe tech firms are spending tens of billions on factories for fun.
Yep me too there are a bunch that have been sitting empty for months .
So another subscriber to the theory that people are spending billions in high tech manufacturing just for fun.
So your theory is that there’s no market for US supplied semiconductors and chips? Because consumer credit debt is flat with pre pandemic if you adjust it for inflation? And these giant corps are just building factories for shits and giggles?
Regard
Thing is, they don't have to be competitive on a strictly price basis.  Paying less for an unreliable resource that is critical to national defense is the most idiotic penny wise pound foolish shit you could possibly dream up.  I mean, I guess we could just decree that if Taiwan is invaded we'll launch a full scale nuclear salvo immediately without question,  but I think even that would have a credibility issue and wouldn't prevent the (definitely already planned and scheduled) invasion of Taiwan.
This is why I laugh when people claim the Intel fabs are going to be some kind of game changer for them.
>and which tsmc just had to ship over engineers  Isn't that kinda expected?  Skilled engineers in my field sometimes get flown out for knowledge transfers and to placate customer whims
Successful manufacturing ecosystems take decades to build.  TSMC is successful in Taiwan because their contractors are experts with deep experience and they’re 5 minutes away.  You don’t get that with one factory build.  You get that with 30 factory builds.
The manufacturing of solar panels are most definitely considering manufacturing.
exactly. i’d argue nominal spending is more important anyhow.  real spending reveals if the output of construction is higher or lower than before  but construction growth isn’t determined by output of projects, it’s determined by what can be afforded  and ultimately whether it’s because inflation or not, nominal spending still reveals the economy is seeing more than twice as much spent on construction  inflation could have just as easily kept spending in check and just fewer project starts. nominal reveals that regardless of output, the economy sees construction as worth twice as much spending.
Do you??
It’s not real! Screamed the Redditor as he sat within arm’s reach of at least 6 lithium batteries and 6 advanced computer chips.
Give “China Over manufacturing” a google ;)
[deleted]
*whoooooooooosh*  the chips cost way too much to make here, due to WAY higher labor/materials/utilities/etc costs.  and tsmc isn't building any cutting edge fabs here.  also, we went from supply constrained (covid) to a glut.  there actually ISN'T a market for this, it's being shoehorned in because politics.
not really.  the costs/etc have already gone much higher than tsmc anticipated.  it's been pretty public...
thanks, captain.
No. But "they" do, and they're the ones writing it off!
So yes, you’re claiming that giant tech firms are dropping tens of billions into factories for a lark.  Galaxy brained take.
So again, your theory is that they are pouring billions into building factories just for fun? Because you, guy on Reddit who probably eats crayons, knows the market better than they do?
Foxxconn didn't "leave China" where are you getting this nonsense from?  Also $260/month is literally below the minimum wage where the foxxconn factories are. The typical factory wage for this kind of work is about $3/hr, or around $600-700 a month depending on overtime.
Semiconductor manufacturing is highly automated. Labor cost isn't the reason fabs are leaving China for Vietnam. Geopolitics is.  Utilities in the US aren't expensive - he'll the world laughs at Americans complaining about gas prices.   Material cost isn't that much a disadvantage for the US since the dollar is strong.
So yes, your theory is that you know this market better than the people pouring billions into it.   How the fuck is politics forcing companies to spend billions? CHIPS have a tax credit to investment in semiconductor manufacturing to lower the initial investment cost. How does that convince companies to foot 75% of the cost for no market genius?
Mate, if the AI revolution is done with enormous labs full of Intel-branded 1060 equivalents, it'll still happen.
No whoosh  It doesn't matter if have chips no one is going to buy 14k iPhone. I live next to ASML their pods come out in airplane shipping crates. They only come out in airplane shipping crates. None of it sold here man.

Money laundering schemes. Contractors make 100s of billions and nothing ever gets manufactured it still counts as GDP LMAO!
yeah, you have no idea what you're talking about... or how much the engineers make in the usa versus taiwan.  ffs, tsmc just mentioned days ago that they had to send engineers over from taiwan to here...  and wtf are you talking about?  you don't really have the right countries...
The people pouring billions in know ABSOLUTELY nothing it’s literally the FED/gov… it’s helicopter money and it counts as GDP. Doesn’t matter what the end result is as long as those GDP numbers get pumped they can keep printing trillions more.
you don't need to tell me you know nothing about this, i already know.
So your credentials are that you have a vague awareness that 2008 happened
Or if the govt simply takes the stance that semiconductor manufacturing is a national security issue. Guess we’ll have to hope that happens one day.  Oh wait….
Weird conspiracy theory that high tech manufacturers are somehow laundering money to contractors but ok
Manufacturing isn't engineer heavy, you muppet.  Also the thread mentions how manufacturer are fleeing China tomorrow vietnam. Not Taiwan and TSMC
Are you literally just hallucinating things right now?
Manhattan alone is enough of a problem.
My credentials are that I'm a IT and smart home specialist. I've have installed the home workstation for more than 6+ of the fortune 500 ceos, also the owner of a major financial news magazine. I shoot the shit with the ones who know.... all of it

I guess I should start making salsa and guac, the only thing you got is the chips. If you were right(you are not). You still need to raise the prices on every other piece. Plastics, glass, boards, diodes and last but not least the FING BATTERY

ermahgerhd.  semiconductor manufacturing IS engineer heavy.  and taiwan had to send engineers over, already.    herp derp.  https://www.reuters.com/technology/tsmc-sending-more-workers-speed-up-building-new-arizona-plant-2023-06-29/  https://forums.appleinsider.com/discussion/232613/tsmc-sends-more-taiwanese-workers-to-finish-arizona-plant  https://9to5mac.com/2023/06/29/tsmc-arizona-chip-plant-delayed/
You must be drunk. Get to AA you need help.
Buddy, your bullshit makes 0 sense. It’s incoherent
That’s great that you can configure the Microsoft suite and all but I really don’t think that qualifies you to comment on semiconductor manufacturing.
Do you get whiplash from changing your stance so often? First there’s no buyer, now they’re going off to foreign countries.
If only there was a massive industry with massive demand for semiconductors with infinite pockets with a vested interest in buying American produced products. Shit. Where we Gona find that.
What the fuck? Chips is a 25% tax credit.
Chips is a tax credit. You need to put down the insane conspiracies and maybe go outdoors or something  Nvm. See you’re a silver investor. Clearly critical thought isn’t your strong suit and incoherent conspiracies and grifts is the best you can do. Carry on.
Don't worry you can't afford what I sell. All of my clients are at the top of financial institutions. They trust me with their house and family security, so I trust what they tell me. Do whatever you want , but come on validating your bs like your about to cheat on your boyfriend

Which program do you feel is pouring billions of govt dollars into high tech manufacturing construction besides chips  And how does it square with the reality that the surge began before chips was passed
Crypto is a scam. But it’s hilarious that you think other people are falling for scams as you invest in silver

There’s nothing to think about here. You’re literally just making things up as you go. It’s hilarious.
You’re literally incoherent. So there’s now some govt program, where they’re giving out loans for manufacturing construction??? And it doesn’t have to be paid back?? What program is this?
Hahahahahahaha

I started my career as an analyst on a derivatives desk for a couple years and now work in fintech.  However, and I can’t stress this enough, it’s irrelevant, as I’m not the one questioning the investment decisions of these massive chip manufacturers and coming up with incoherent theories about them spending billions to hide toxic assets for fun or soemthing.  I am questioning you, the guy on Reddit who has posited these senseless theories based on him installing windows 11 for an executive or somethin
Yes, most intelligent people don't have good people skills, they don't need them to pander to people. They're intelligent, people pander to them.
It’s awesome that you’re filled with literally endless financial conspiracy theories
You literally can’t stop coming up with conspiracies. It’s amazing.  What the hell is a mod hit man?  Did you even say anything that a mod would care about? It’s mostly been incoherent and rambling but nothing I’d think of as problematic
So these govt programs are purely fantasy based? You can’t point to a single one?

You’ve literally already laid out your theory that someone is for some reason just throwing billions of dollars into building high tech factories that will produce nothing with no buyers, but also selling to foreign countries somehow, for literally no reason. I don’t see why you’d think laying it out again would make it more coherent.   If anything this has become less coherent.  I think you should stick to installing ring doorbells.
I suppose that means something to you and think it makes your argument one of authority. Your childhood is not a credential and adds no weight to whatever point you think you're making.

I don’t know why you keep thinking this whole theory that they’re building factories just to sell them for a loss later will make more sense if you restate it over and over.
It's called anecdotal and there's a difference between being deemed crazy by those that can't empathise and 'going crazy' Being deemed crazy doesn't mean you actually have a mental illness or incapacity, it just means society, with it's current or general knowledge, can't understand you. 'Going crazy' if it's not just the exaggerated expression is a physiological reaction to mental exhaustion/genetics/trauma
The coffee situation is subpar, ngl. In office there’s a shit keurig but the building has a shop downstairs. I’m only on site half the days though so it’s whatever. Why does zero hedges maid also make coffee? Or are you gunning for a job?

Bud, no matter how many times you rephrase this, the idea that they’re for some reason throwing good money after bad makes 0 sense.   You also hilariously keep blaming everything on blackrock while ignoring that most of the investment is coming from companies like Intel and ford. But whatever.
[deleted]
Oh man. It’s been fun watching you pretend the standard incoherent blackrock conspiracies are something you heard from some executives maid or something
[deleted]
That is not financial advice but a cranial rectum procedure
Hahahahaha oh my god. This is hilarious. So now blackrock is for some reason forcing the companies it invests in to invest billions into building factories that will never make anything for some reason.

I'm pretty sure those laptops are missing screens. This means that he loses less money than a RIVN investor since he can't possibly invest.
This guy probably reading comments on wallstreetbets for good advice
this is lowkey a vibe trading on the streets
You don't need it to kill $TSLA You just need it to perform well. How does 1 stock kill the other? Cost per Share? Market Cap? Come on man😒 unless you're comparing upside potential.
RIVN just put out good numbers. Plus the Amazon deal and I see lots of them around. I’m going to keep buying
That's right RIVN gonna kill TSLA so hard it had to go into agreement with Musk to access his supercharger network.
I see rivian and lucid on the roads all the time as I'm right where there are headquartered. Them sumbitches are ugly as fuck up close. Not saying tsla doesn't have its problems my coworkers cars have all kinds of body alignment issues. Tsla being cult they don't care they paid $60K+ on  a car that doors are not aligned properly
It will 100% be a contender
Tesla will just buy Rivian eventually, all they’ll merge with another car company
Hollu shit
It’s funny to see WSB try to get TSLA to tank.   Keep buying those puts, 🌈 🐻.

I have seen like 300% more of these in the pat two days. Tbh that’s two. But still. Looking up
RIVN isn’t a Tesla killer, it has its own niche. Regard is as regard does.
Lol so many people don't even have 1 laptop 🤣
Saw one in the wild for the first time yesterday, it is a nice looking truck.
Ticket to the moon
It will NEVER happen... at least not in the foreseeable future.  Tesla is a data company, a car manufacturer(that is already 10 years ahead of Rivian), a small home manufacturer, and a solar/battery manufacturer.  Rivian builds overpriced electric trucks...  Not entirely sure how Rivian will ever catch up and pass Tesla.
That man is awaiting to buy puts on something tomorrow
You got scammed.
i lost 10k buying puts on RIVN last week....
I listened to some streamer online that sure broke it all down convincingly so I bought 10 call options expiring in 4 weeks and sold them last week. Was so annoyed that that whole 37 min video didn’t once mention a delivery report coming out. I should have looked into it myself though.

Where did you come up with this? Sounds like an ancient chinese joke.
When I was homeless, I once found a non-functioning giant Alienware laptop in the trash. It would turn on but the screen was black all the time so I couldn't find anyone to sell it to, but I noticed it was getting extremely hot. There was an outlet next to where I slept, so I basically put it under my blanket every night in the winter so I wouldn't freeze.  This thing made my life so much easier back then because sleeping outside in the winter was always a life-threatening situation otherwise.

Buying puts on recent IPO's as soon as they become available is just a good all around strategy in general.  At the very least, there's always some amount of founders/early investors ready and waiting to dump shares and get paid as soon as their lockup periods are over.  Not to mention the fact that companies tend to go public to access capital in ways they couldn't as private businesses, ie share offerings.
What was your thesis though? It had just started picking up sentiment after being flat for the last 3-4 months, you must've shorted just when it started breaking out?

Tesla is uglier than Lucid but it still became successful.
at this rate it might be the only way for Tesla to get a truck to market
This reminds me of the RIVN regards saying the exact same thing to XPEV and NIO bagholders 1-2 years back. If you just turned off your ego and bought TSLA instead of being a contrarian, you wouldn't be here still pumping your bag while desperately holding onto the "TSLA killer" narrative. Only thing any of these "TSLA killers" killed were your portfolios.
Is it though? Their balance sheet is worse than RIVN, and Lucid's owner has a personal issue with Musk which prevents them from adopting Tesla's charge cable.
Elon musk isn’t a Nazi though.

Perpetual motion..they solved it!
This is r/technicallythetruth
You’ve shorted while I’ve made 150.47% on my $50,000 in calls in two days… hop on board the RIVN soul train, we are just getting rolling
Why bro? Why? Why short a company that Amazon pretty much owns? Amazon will have the entire fleet being RIVN in less than 5 years?
lol exact same shit here, are you still holding or you're out already ?
You shouldn’t short it at this point. Based on technical analysis it is above a breakout level and is more likely to go near 30 than it is to hit 10. I’ve been way off before and learned if I don’t just cut it it can always get way worse

Same boat, 12k down buying $15 15.5 puts expiring this Friday. Sometimes the market feels manipulated as fuck

I mean he flirts with it everyday on twitter. That's been his trajectory the last few years.
Both rivian and tesla have shot up in the past 6 days so take your pick lol.
But they had a delivery report coming out. It was going to move a lot regardless. Be better off shorting the spy or target
Dude. Wyd? Lol

It's real too
What’s funny about homelessnesses?
I mean I'm guilty of selling way too early so definitely not immune to letting emotions get the better of me at times, but not sure why they were trying to short something that had bottomed recently w/o letting it run a little first - could've been a reason that I'm overlooking though so was curious
Omg this is a brilliant idea for a Holywood movie. I should pitch it for my colleagues tomorrow.   I can already smell money 💰
What's funny is the "monstrosity" will probably outsell the Rivian
How much is it?
Henry Ford often said about how much he hated Jewish people. He was an actual Nazi
Downvoted
 I shorted right after powell mentioned that rate hikes still have a long way to go, that's a strong bearish signal from what i've been seeing for the past year, plus competitors going bankrupt like Lordstown was also an indicator that a bearish EV sector is in the horizon, combine all of that with not having an exit strategy (because hey stocks go up and down right ?) but in Rivians case this is the 6th consecutive bullish day with an average of +5% increase daily, CRAZY !, I guess my best option now is to get away with what's left and start over
Of course, I’m just speaking from a subjective perspective. Tesla is the bigger company and is already ingrained into the American car pipeline.
They aren’t cheap. Their cheapest is like 80k, one of the reasons I think rivian hasn’t advanced as much. They need cheaper options.
Hmm I have never seen a Lordstown car in person but Rivians are starting to pop up similar how Tesla started popping up in downtown areas of cities like 10+ years ago.  I think there is a big difference between Lordstown and Rivian.   Rivian is also backed by Amazon.   And their truck won the Motor Trend award for best truck of the year last year or this year.
Yea I've fallen victim to that a few times too but I was trading SPX not an individual ticker, initially during the hikes you could have a higher than 50% WR, anecdotally speaking, if you were able to interpret what he was saying and scalp.  Those days are gone though, now bearish things he says/bullish things he says don't have a corresponding realtime impact on the mkt - stopped trading what he was saying after getting sunk a couple of times because of it.  Lordstown though isn't the best comp to RIVN, RIVN was AMZN's pet project while Lordstown was a startup that had to give up its factory to Foxconn just to be able to afford getting vehicles produced... in addition to the various lawsuits and issues they were being plagued by  None of the following is advice ... but if you believe in TA/resistances/supply demand zones etc. and you want to check and see how far it currently is from them and whether you wait it out to see if there's a rejection before exiting that might be something to consider... then again if you're already in a hole and have no faith in the play/exit strategy the r/r is already against you could not be worth waiting and finding out... either way consider hedging next time, might help minimize the potential loss if the move goes against you
Understand that markets are assuming he's bluffing.
> TA/resistances/supply demand  I definitely see some room for Rivian to go down since they'll have to lower their price drastically soon to keep up with the market, they'd be burning more money every month and their cash reserve will take a hit so I'd probably go for a 50/50 solution where i close half of the short position and keep the other half to minimize any potential upcoming loses and make my short position more durable, appreciate all the info!
Canadian banks have strait up pushed amortization of more than 1/4 of their mortgages over 35 years (generally from original max of 25 years).  There are ways to kick the can down the road that guarantee a bigger catastrophe is coming…and make timing any play based on a crash nearly impossible.
Everything ever is already priced in.
Why everyone on WSB thinks he's Michael Burry? Show me your research, and i may believe you.
Shorting UK banks that generally have a good business model is risky. Not because they couldn’t tank but because you can’t know the timeline. Especially since the warnings are also politically motivated.   I personally wait till the UK gets deep into crisis and gets rid of the current government. Next government is likely to try to get into single market or at least get better access to EU market and that’s around the point I plan to buy some UK titles that may be undervalued then.  But timing the market is a fools errand anyway so I’ll probably miss the time ^^
UK here.   Mortgages are fine.   Most people take fixed term mortgages. So a mortgage won't just implode. And banks don't charge the base rate (if only) and already factor in rate rises into risk analysis when determining their rates.   The people that will get fucked are those that were already paying too big a percentage of their wages and were stupid enough to only take a short fixed term of 2 years or whatever and are now due to remortgage.   Depending where they're at they're looking at up to doubling their current mortgage payments. ON TOP of our still awful inflation.  So if someone was paying a third of their wages or more on their mortgage they're fucked. That's now 66% to 100% of their wages. Except the remaining 33% at the low end is still fucked because of inflation. Basically bills are now going to be over 100% of wages. Fun times.   I'm also personally fucked because I'm looking to buy in the near future. If rates don't come back down over the next couple of years I'm fucked unless the housing market crashes (which it could). Financial we're ok now but have the opposite problem. We can now only afford a house worth half what we could previously. Which severely limits our options.  Rentals are even more fucked for landlords.   Taking on a new property or remortgaging means double mortgage payments compared to previous. But obviously there's pressure not to just double rents and you can't just do it willy nilly anyway. But the fun part.. the hilarious part?..  They're changing tax laws for landlords. Instead of being taxed on profit (rent minus mortgage) they will no longer be allowed to do that offset. They will be taxed on 100% of rent. Even if after a mortgage rise they're only keeping 10% of the money as profit. Taxes could end up being higher than yield for some landlords.   So.. fuck loads are getting out. The rental market is about to get decimated at the same time.   I'm just watching the chaos hoping our housing market crashes. Sorry for all the people that'll go into negative equity and all but I want a house damn it.   This comment ended up being longer than some of you spend at the dumpster behind Wendy's. My bad.
Inflation always hits goods first and wages second.  All these things are going up, but the mortgage payments won't (generally). Not a problem.
UK mortgages suck in general. 2-5 year fixed is all you get. No such thing as 30. Oof
Does this mean I buy puts?
Yay cheap Harry Potter homes. Sucks that you have to get the curry smell out.
Aren't most on r/wallstreetbets (by most I mean 9999%) american?   Who cares about Britain? I never cared about Brittany. She was shit girl who licked my asshole. Why would I care?
Been priced in for 6 months. Do what I do, get a magic orb to see the future, that way you don’t miss these opportunities.
Bullish for America
what banks trade on US markets?
Yea the problem is kind of three fold. Problem one is that we have no idea how many years they can delay. Problem two is that they've already been reporting all of this risk and have already traded down a bit. Problem 3 is that a lot of the real pain will be absorbed by the CMHC.
Personally I think the banks will succeed and save the housing market.  But you are 100%.  Crash or not it’s impossible to play.  The best way to play it at this point is like a 60/40 retirement fund.  That’s no fun.  May as well be betting on an invasion of Taiwan.
I’m starting to think you’re actually Jamie Dixon
Savage
I have a rule to never watch the big short during a trading day.
Bud, you typed so many words to say when a person has to refinance with a higher rate, they need more money to pay it.  “Loads are getting out”
Any data on what percentage take the variable rate mortgage?
We can do 10. And who wants a 30 year mortgage. Ew.   We should be able to just fix for the full term though.   Oh well. Guess I'll take it over medical debt.
Yes, buy puts on nVida.
I don't know what TCU basketball has to do with this, but Jamie Dimon is the CEO of a major bank.
I did think about being bud light but I didn't want people to short me.
There is a 10?  Since when, didn’t think that was an option from when I was there. Ppl want 30 just to minimize expense when you know it’s not a forever home
At 2.5, i’ll take 30 every day and twice on Sunday.
No idea.   It's just kinda there when I've been looking to buy and checking prices.   Does only seem available on lower LTV though.
My factory went from building 21 a day 5 days a week to 14 a day 4 days a week. This is huge for us. Looks like all the poor people that wanted a trailer park home got their wish.
No one wants mortgages at the current rates. Rent isn’t getting any cheaper either.  Wish I could move back home with my parents 😭
Who needs houses when we can just build rocket ships! 🚀
someone gave an all cash offer for my sibling's house in the bay, 1.9m  ppl still buying
This article was written by Ai...as was this comment
Housing will never become affordable. The people who own housing have all the money and power and have no reason to ever let themselves lose that. Housing will stay expensive for that reason.
Puts on ITB
People been saying that since 2016
But but this sub alone would have so many regards losing their savings on trades and defaulting on loans leading to foreclosures so why not go for those as they are cheaper?
So many tops over my decades of owning real estate
I can’t see Twitter anymore but I believe  u/Ready_the_Rhinos that this shows rents going down (up less quickly).   https://twitter.com/JosephPolitano/status/1668598731128598532
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Housing prices like stonks only up specifically in California.
You know nothing about real estate if you think this is the top. Is a dip coming, of course but not in all areas and not evenly. All those people waiting for rates to fall to buy are going to be deeply disappointed as prices will shoot up again with increased demand. Bought another rental last October and hoping to add another. Appreciation is very consistent
I'm about to sell my 2019 purchased home and move my family back into my parents homestead to help my mom out a bit. If we really need a home, we can build one on the land we already own. I can sit on the funds for awhile, let it vest, put in a bond or something safe, and with no mortgage or debt, we can take our time starting up our own business safely. 🥳  I'm thinking with the lack of inventory prices stay high. If rates drop people will just snag them up regardless.
kept tapping the wrong upvote button
In Canaduh's world you banks won't mortgage trailers
Nope
Brick by brick, we'll watch the real estate empire crumble! 🏢😅
Don't worry, I already built my house on the moon! 🚀
Mine went from 9 a day every day 5 days a week, to 4 a day for 4 days a week plus work 2 weeks then week off no pay then repeat..
I'm in new home construction. I went from 9-15 builds a week to 0-3. All these builders have been shitting their britches since about February and they all keep saying we'll be alright and we'll pick back up again but hell man, it's a whole new kind of stress.
I'd say wait for them to die and you can inherit their home....but they probably left you out of the will anyway.
>Wish I could move back home with my parents 😭  I legit thought about pushing for it. Am mid 30's, but being able to rent out my house for a few months would help me massively in building some money to buy another house to live in and then rent out once that mortgage matures.
At this point in my life I just want to build a submarine.
Bay is a different animal from a lot of the rest of the county.
Yeah my sister just bought a 800 sq ft house in LA for $1.3 million and it was a bidding war. It’s still a shit show out there
i think this part would be fun to say.    I believe people are downsizing.
It shows rent inflation going down.
I am noticing prices and rents coming down slightly, still high tho.
It's not even below 0%.  This chart shows change year over year so it just means they aren't increasing.  They are staying the same.
Twitter doesn’t work anymore. Never planned on signing up.
There is a dip in high end homes and covid boomtowns like Boise.  Cities with robust local economies are basically right back to ATH with median priced homes. Here anything $1m and under are getting multiple offers and selling in three days again. The $3m+ luxury properties are sitting though.
I, too, am bullish when I already bought calls.
Enjoy bankruptcy
I hope you lose everything leech
Clayton Homes?
Where is this? I can’t find a builder in OBX, NC. All are too busy to return calls.
The nursing home takes the house.
As someone expecting inheritance but knowing i mighta fucked up enough times to be written out, this is extremely triggering
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
What happens if both my parents rent?
Sad part is I’m an only child lmaooo totally written out of it after playing options
indeed
Jeez is your sister single bro?
800 square feet is a one bedroom apartment
What a terrible price per square footage. Did she just  invest in NVDA too?
The rents have definitely dropped out here in Austin, TX.
Potato potato.  Don’t suppose you have a screen cap?
agreed, where I am most apartments going for higher than listing in a bidding war, even apartments for rent are flying off like Costco hotdogs
He's probably fine.  Real estate loans require 20-25% down, so it would take a major crash for him to get under water to the point of insolvency.    Maybe he takes an L, but a long way before chapter 11.
Anyone that profits excessively off of a basic human need is a leech!  Go do something productive you leeches
How the fuck do all these people ![img](emote|t5_2th52|27189) work in house factories? I didn’t even know that was a thing
OBX is second home world.  The “sunshine belt” is perpetually getting the NE and California down trading.
I will confirm that , I’ve been trying for 2 years to get a builder in Corolla NC to give me the time of day .
Who are you calling? The big dogs are building spec homes to maintain and pay the people they didn't layoff in February. The local guys aren't doing dick. They're so scared inventory won't move you sit and watch the available lot sign and hope it says purchased next time you come around. So much developed land just sitting there. 2 years ago I had 100 slabs in one community that  were horribly behind schedule. Now I can drive around the city and count 100 slabs.
It's that one simple trick nursing homes don't want you to know.
Ever hear of a trust?
Suicide is a great option if you have kids and are reaching retirement age. That’s my plan!
Yep, it’s all rigged
Do you feel you deserve to be written out?
....then you get nothing but a bill from the nursing home.
It’s a 2/1 lol. I think it’s ridiculous too. It does have a giant back yard and a view of the city since it’s up on one of the hills so I can kind of get it. She paid $300k over the listing bc of the bidding war tho. Crazy
I think it was over $1000 per square foot
You called?
Chapter 7 actually
It's a trip dude. Never seen anything like it. Takes me 8 minutes to install and wire a breaker panel in a single wide trailer. It's good money.
Exactly, I'm like what the hell are these muhfuckas talking about lol
![img](emote|t5_2th52|29637)
Thats my plan, minus the kids.
>Suicide is a great option if you have kids and are reaching retirement age. That’s my plan!  My plan is surprise suicide. I'm eating like a pig and living hard so I don't see retirement age. One day I'll be working hard on the job and just drop dead of a stroke or heart attack. Which is handy because there won't be any money to retire with anyway.
Jokes, jokes. We have a strained parental relationship and My brother and i are in a back and forth to be the worst son. Im currently the golden child.
$1000 per square foot is normal for the area around the Google campus in L.A.
Probably up north? I’m in Florida I don’t think we have factories but I’m sure we import the trailers
Can't build them trailer parks without trailers dude. This is gonna blow your mind but, everything around is made or built by someone. It's crazy I tell ya.
Make sure you have an advance directive. Mine states that if my quality of life would be significantly lower after resuscitation they are to let me die.

Cope and seeth bulls. We're going down HARD thanks to all you soft fucks.
To be fair, are there really a lot of Bears who *only* came out of the closet and turned gaybear 7 months ago?  Most would have been bearish long before that in Q4 ‘21 - Q1 ‘22 and would have done alright over the past 1.5 - 2 yrs having not been decimated in ‘22.
I am bearish cause in my wallet, is less and less and less each month ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)
It’s rigged to do well lol its like 90% of people want things not to go to shit so bears can live this 08 fantasy that if they were older this time they would be there and make $ off all the fear.   They got a nice shot if dope when Covid hit and the market tanked and then ripped and ever since then it’s the end of the world every week.

I just lost like 3 dollars. I am very grateful that I have no trade any options, options trading are very risky for bears, the market only goes up.

This. Does no one else remember panicking when we had -6% and -8% index days?  That was crash you either knew was happening or panic and didn't look at your account until it was over.
I start to believe guys like you, then I zoom out to "all time" chart of S&P or Nasdaq and think "ummm no thanks, we are in a crazy bubble".
Spooky how that guy has never posted since that day

Selling is literally an indicator for market makers to raise the price instantly by 100% just FYI buying is the opposite. It’s not by chance it’s by design.
Whatever you were thinking of doing... Do the opposite.
Yep always caught the 2020 run and been hooked in garbage ever since
You're not alone, my friend. We're all in this crayon-covered rollercoaster together!

you're missing a line that goes straight down for the stock you bought options on

This is literally the last three years of my portfolio. How do I make it the exact opposite
How did they get my portfolio.
I don’t care I just buy more 🙂
I recently bought $RIVN calls. Held for 2 days and made approx. 160%. In the following 2 days, the calls increased another 300%.
I sold RIVN last Friday.
Never fails 😂
All the effing time. It's even worse with options. Sell it and then shit increase in value and then you are looking dumb because you sold for a 50-100% loss and it ends up gaining 200%, but it's truly a life lesson in trusting your gut and being patient.
Every day
I am the king of buying calls when a stock is at that all time high. Like sometimes I can pick it within a single dollar figure.
stonks are literally just an algorithm tailored to leech money out of retail investors so its not surprising this is such a common experience
It hurts so bad.

I bought meta on 380 Then averaged down every time she fell She kept free falling I got into a situation where meta is 50% of my portfolio and the avg price is 314. I see her keep falling and i say to myself don't buy anymore. I see her get to 80$ and don't buy, knowing i should. Staring at meta ever since going to the moon. Holding the bag without making a dime, waiting it will get back to 314 so i can drop the damn stock.
Im triggered i guess
Nope one of mine Ran 17% today.
Are u me??
Too Real !!!
Man that was me last month, I missed out on 30k+ in gains cuz I sold a day or 2 too early. Instead I ended up eating dirt last couple of weeks.
Enphase Energy.. big-time.

I sold rack space at 1.25 and literally 2-5 mins later it started going up and now at 2.65. This has happened a few times. Literally minutes later
The stocks you thought about buying that went to 0, but you never thought about them again.
Ngl I haven’t checked my stocks in like 6 months, most peaceful 6 months ever
I had a 27% increase in 1 day today. Not selling.

$TMC stock for met. Wanted to buy it at ,74 is now at 1,92 damnn.
You win some and you lose some. Unfortunately it seems like I lose more than I win
Same with me just it's the other way around... :( I feel left out
That's the most accurate depiction of my trading experience I have ever come across
Just look for stocks with ridiculous price movements and buy it.
The acid is still on I guess
And all my paper trades do the opposite..fuck this game
Yah, Facebook and Nvidia last year, ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|cry)
Not that bad but that’s about how is goes. I wonder how people’s crypto goes.

The worst thing is selling a stock, it drops 3% so you feel good for selling, and then the next day it goes up 7% above your cost basis and just keeps going up.

Oh yeah, my worst decision other than selling my last house was selling MSFT for $18 a few years back. Those two investments would have made me another 1M+. What’s worse is that Redfin continues to send me updates about “my home value” and I haven’t yet deleted MSFT from my yahoo port tracker ☹️
Yes and yes. And yes. But you know what? Yes
Indeed, upside down view is also the same...
yeah, that's me now. I could sell my portfolio tomorrow, and recession (I know, there's no recession) will be solved! Too lazy to try to do anything with calls and puts at the moment.
thats majority of us, they can use their algo, and worst, payment for order flow to see what we are selling it at, and use it to their advantage
I’m chilling with my portfolio, everyone else just doesn’t know how to buy at the right time. Buy major crashes/bad news events, sell when everyone says we’re going to infinity. It’s that simple
Im maybe only in the stock market for just a year but i havent sold any stocks yet
FACTSSS 😭
I missed out on hella gains so far this year but also avoided hella losses. I managed to live to play the infinite game another day, which is a type of success.
Yellow is the next week's calls after yours expire worthless
Cannabis but not so much lately. Merely opportunities to quintruple down.
Me down bad
Yup part of the process
Lol me when I recommended buying Nividia and Meta a year ago to others, but I never did myself 😭
Looks like Loki messed up the timeline again.
Rotate the charge 90 degrees counterclockwise and everyone wins!
every single time
If you are that bad at picking stocks, might as well just buy SPY or QQQ
Is Sirius/XM going to be the one I’m bag holding for?…
My portfolio over the last year 😩
Iv been holding one of all I sell and then waiting to buy it on the dip
I'm starting to feel some real fomo on Tesla stocks. I'll let you know when i cave in and buy. That'll be everyone's queue to sell the top. I have a pretty good track record of buying at the top.
When you’re in this business for long enough you get use to it. There will always be another wave to catch.
No i just joined nvda and tsla as they very obviously reversed and trended higher. Stop trying to time reversals or buy dog shit stocks that were once $$$ and are now $. That doesn't mean they are going back to $$$
My coin calls i sold for 200% but could have held and sold for 800%
I remember laughing about TSLA end of last year and then NVDA and CVNA etc…. Good time.

everyday i do
Simple solution:  Inverse yourself  That way when you're wrong, you make money, but when you're right, you're still right and smarter than everyone else.  Win-Win.
Me in 2010 about to buy 10000 bitcoins…..
Looks about right
Dude I swear this has something to do with quantum mechanics that we don't understand yet
I feel like this always happen unless you buy enough shares/contracts to offset the games MM play. I feel like they phuck with us psychologically because they can and it pays!
That pretty much sums up my daily life. But you have to realize that if you catch a handful of these winners, ie TSLA and MSTR, you're ahead of the game. We tend to focus on the missed opportunities. We have to be grateful for all those opportunities in front of us.
this is me.  someone could run an inverse to my portfolio and make a killing.
In the great words of pops “you win some & you lose some, but you live!!! You live!!! to fight another day”
Did you just hack my brain?! ![img](emote|t5_2th52|31225)  Get outa there!! ![img](emote|t5_2th52|27421)
You guys sell stocks?
This hurts so bad to look at.  The pain is real 😂
Nope, almost all off mine were climbing the past three trading days.
I can relate to this.
“I like the stock”
Can't relate
Only when I’m awake and breathing
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260)
This called holding too long :)
Every fing time... I think I am the catalyst for a stock to drop as soon as I buy it
Is this that old Winamp visualizer plugin?
Story of my adult life. Or also buying $200 dollars worth of a stock that explodes to the moon but $2000 worth of a stock that plummets 🤦🏾‍♀️

My Nio stock lol
That's it in a nut shell
Let me tell you about the time I bought $900 of TSLA in my ROTH when it IPO’d at $27/share and sold just days later at $20/share. I think it’d be worth over $200,000 today. And did I mention that $199,000 of gain would be tax free?
That is so me
The yellow one almost looks like it’s flipping you off
#facts
Skill issue tbh…
……who got ahold of my portfolio???
I AM THE CATALYST.
Most of my trades 🤷‍♂️
Yeah definitely right buddy i do believe on you and Also this thing make me laugh because i encounter the same thing before
FB. Best was the regard who held bragged about all his gains here. I got to stare at them when I knew I sold two hours before like a fucking pussy
Buy a position. It goes against you.  You add to the position. It keeps going against you.  It recovers to even. You hold.  It goes against you again. You cry a bit.  It recovers a bit above your basis. You sell.  It flies. You cry more.
Does something like this ever happen?  Like winning the lottery :)
Ohm the answer was maybe yes maybe no bit probably maybe brother im not pretty sure as well
Literally 2 minutes after I buy it.
Bien
Excuse my ignorance here, can you explain like I'm a toddler ape how it "crashes ITM"? Not looking for financial advice, I only know how to fling poo and eat bananas!!!
I sold some puts for a 15% gain the other day, then within five minutes the stock dropped $4.
These bags are killing my back!!! Damn you Lucid!!!
Actually because maybe you post it online thats why it liks brother
All you bummers who think money is earned on the stock market: Get a real a career that pays in the long run, care for your employees, produce tangible goods and services, invest in machines and properies that are needed to get the job done. And yes, please downvote me ;-)
Them: HODL… Me: STFU
Mans performance history is going *left*
Im not lying- Im really really bad at this. I sold $15k of Adobe on like May 15th that id been holding for a yr and it had just broke even. Many many bad decisions have been made this year. Team Wendys atw
[If every instinct you have is wrong, then the opposite would have be right.](https://youtu.be/RerJWv5vwxc?t=19)
Exactly the word buddy i do believe on you i support your decision anyways
Does it work like inverse Cramer? The only thing I agree with this guy on is Wendy's LOL!!! Solid fast food chain and their food isn't crazy expensive either!
QQQsQQQ?
Exactly you make me laugh brother. Even though I wasn't their i use my imagination to see there facial reaction to be honest with you buddy. I kinda like it I can't stop laughing
I lost a boatload of money but at least I have balls
Diamond hands but barefoot next to a trashfire for warmth.
Será que bajar
I’m so poor I have no shorts
Well to be honest with you guy's i do believe on you because seen to be you have a strong personality anyways im so proud of you buddy because you did well to anything
Exactly the word buddy i like your idea because it was an idea of a big brain person i like your common sense anyways
So the options market is designed to take my money?  *Those bastards!*
What’s that shit called where the price just goes to where the liquidity is to maximize the liquidation of people on leverage lol.
But what if you are already thinking of doing the opposite???
Nvidia and Apple.
Dad?  You're on the wrong thread.
We don't serve your kind here.
Complacently gifting your board votes to blackrock I see
The drop from 1200 to 100 was pretty epic, glad it’s climbing again
Same!!!
Sell at open tomorrow if you don't hate money.
Diamond hand deez nutz 🌰🌰
Same
Say that to my wallet. Go on, tell it.
Do as much research as possible and trust your gut, don't succumb to selling because you see red, if the research says this company is undervalued, you hold, until the data proves otherwise.
Just wait till u get at the wendys dumpster
Sooooo... You made like 2 bucks?
U think its a good investment..just bought it but 5k in stocks only?
How much doge did you own to make it jump up like that?
Just hit 1,95............ :(
It's 'should have', never 'should of'.  Rejoice, for you have been blessed by CouldWouldShouldBot!
My favorite was when I missed life changing money with a stock I had invested in a whole year before anyone noticed how shorted it was because I legitimately didn’t know wtf I was doing so I just invested in brands and companies I used. Then when I went to sell and change my life the 2/3 of the market was prevented from doing so by Citadel Securities.
Its a kind of disgusting to be honest with you specially i was wondering if why you're words didn't ban?
You said it!  TSLA is an example….
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260)
Is this a haiku of my investment history? 🤔
Exactly buddy that's what ive been thing for such a long time of period that's why ive been wanna investigating the story behind that's why i wanna sh*t up buddy
Every. Time.
Sounds like he's holding puts as "crashing" is a severe downward move. Either way, he's basically saying he closed his position (or didn't open one) right at the inflection point where the stock reversed, and he would have made $$ if he held for 5 more minutes.
ITM means *in the money*.  Commenter is referring to option positions which can be very sensitive to price.
Yeah, “crashes,” might be too unspecific, but I meant for either a call or put position, I sell it and 2 minutes later it’s green and making money ☹️
Classic. My favorite is selling a call for 20% gain and then 5 minutes later the stock moons 🧐
Why you think about it buddy huh? I wanna know more about it can you explain it more please
Please sell so it will 🚀
Really a nice car tho, I want one.
Go get a submarine
Hm you make me think about this huh? I will do more search regarding to this thing buddy because this thing make me though to be honest with you i wanna do more about it
You get my downvote cause you're making it sound "easy" and ignoring the fact that there is also LUCK involved when a company or business actually succeeds or fails.  Anyone that has started a successful business that tells you there was no luck involved in the success of their business, only hard work, is either lying to you or could never repeat their success. Luck doesn't diminish the importance of hard work either.  Hard work is what allows you to capitalize on the luck when it presents itself. You can work hard and do everything right but STILL fail at starting a business and I'm not even talking about failing because of some black swan event like the COVID pandemic.
You must not be good at the stock market  I make a sustainable $1-2k every day in it (it's my main source of income now) lmao.  I'm 25.
Learning how to trade is a career?!?! The automod accusing me of illegal financial advice, when it's NOT my intention to do so?!?!?! Very very confusing!!!
Can you please use the acrostic word rather than to use that letters
What do you mean by that huh? I don't understand what are you talking about? Huh would you mind to please explain it more huh? I wanna know more about it buddy
Breakfast is 🔥 from Wendy's!
Ahm if you say so it was then good because in our country we don't have Wendy's
Hahaha thanks bro! I'm glad you found it entertaining. I love how honest people are on WallStreetBets about their losses and poor decisions! The 2021 me was diamond hands, now its 2023 and I have a kid! 2023 turned me into paperhands LOL!!!  I bought stocks AND crypto in 2021!!!! Heavy ass bags bro LOL!!!!!
> I lost a boatload of money but at least I have ~~balls~~ low impulse control and massive FOMO.
We all do Wendy's dumpster is booming.
Yeah same! I got myself liquidated, I borrowed excessively from Robinhood and paid the price for it LOL!
You are cappin. People wouldn't stay away from there money.
Takes a man to admit how colossally wrong he was. Nice job, regard.
The market has my money and you have my upvote,comrade.
Herniated balls, but balls nonetheless.
The raccoons who moved into the dumpster seem nice too.
Diamond hands tends to be a winning strategy! Buy and hold is always excellent investing advice for any stock you believe in! But this is wallstreetbets, so it's ride or die, lambos or food stamps LOL!!!  The volatility on stock options is INSANE, but you can win if you play your cards the right way!!!
Oh what a lovely word's  A lovely word's that remains a word at the end of the day. Anyways i like you spoken word i make a spoken word poetry but most at a time it regards when i loss my way
Yeah so you aren't believe to them i am right? Geez the worse wasn't yet to come
Max pain price, but it doesn't go there all the time, otherwise it would be a viable strategy to make money. it's 50/50
Delete app and redownload and re assess
We are too regarded to buy index funds
> Do as much research as possible  Ehh, don't know about this one. I honestly think the more in depth I research something, the more I second guess myself and then it becomes "paralysis by over analysis".  You want to do "some" research. You want to understand the companies business model. You want to hear a bear thesis and a bull thesis about the company and look into the positive and negative aspects. But you don't want to go so deep that you can't make a decision either way
Funny! More like $80. Phone bill is paid for the month though, I'll tell you that! That's the point of this, no? And I started with $200. Who else's graph looks like this regardless of portfolio balance YTD, raise your hands!  https://preview.redd.it/a7atwee65y9b1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=70212eb7d0f2215675a349fbe03fabf578937544
Kind of funny how many people think this is all down to their own bad luck and not a rigged system
Except Robinhood disabled the buy button, not the sell button.  Cool story though, you fucking poser. Everyone here knew the short interest a year before it popped.
Haha think lots of retail got shutout from selling the massive Pamp
Speak English
Ohhh I see this makes sense thank you!!! I already know what in the money means, but I didn't understand exactly what he meant. Appreciate this explanation!
That really sucks bro!!! I would be SO PISSED at myself if I did this LOL I can't even imagine!!!
Paper hands taking more and more victims every day.
You can buy that someday you must to grind hard or should i say work smart not harder though
They already did bro then he can get a five life buddy watch the movie
you get my upvote because i totally agree with you.  I do not even have any investment in stock or the likes, but I do like to be informed. So then you see these kids, who inherrit money, have some luck for a while and think that is the new life style. They actually believe they invented some new kind of work. Its just a gamble. Luck for an entrepreneur/engineer like myself is PART of the equation. And yes, my life has not been EASY so far, but satisfying from time to time.

Definitely right i also confused with this that's why i make a lot of research regarding to this buddy
Actually it depends upon to the people buddy. Perhaps some of the people visit in the lunch time
I want to get it eventually!!! I love their dinner food, I gotta get some Wendy's breakfast soon!!!
People wouldn't left their money somewhere else because we are like a chicken which shaded the egg
Spoken like a bitch without balls
Unironically I do want to invest in Wendy's LOL!!!!
You mean the cost player of Robinhood not the actual one right?

OOF
No cap ong frfr
They will punish them if they will make a wrong move anyways
That's what ive been thinking about buddy can i know the reason please
A raccoon? Sorry what do you mean i didn't see any racoons in this subs
But when?  Please teach me oh wise one.   My picks are poop.
Are you a chat GPT bot or just an 11 year old kid
Wow what a cruel words to say. Can i ask if you are mad or something else?
So, in the end, it comes to researching and gaining all relevant data to make a decision. Collecting as much data as possible and processing it effectively is how to find relevant data that will impact future trading decisions. Company A is having a earnings call, will they beat or underperform? so you'd go through the earnings and the relevant economic data and historical price data, general economic trends and make the decision to buy puts/calls/both. If you didn't get as much data as possible, how would you know that you missed something that didn't factor into in the anticipated future price of the stock? Lawsuits, closed down stores, etc., which if missed would make your valuation erroneous. I'm not saying it has to be perfect, there is always a margin of error, but it does have to be accurate.
Nice profit line. But yeah making money is the point. Was just goofing around   I'm currently at -€515,31. Kinda suck at this....

It’ll happen, just you wait 😭
I don't know where this sentence begins or ends
NOW ya get my upvote! So many posts here with these insane gambles lack perspective and fail to state some of these “bets” that are the size of yearly salaries are only a small part of their portfolios or they’re trust fund kiddies.
Yes we need visual proof!! People do post some sexy gain porn!! Makes me jealous as fuck I won't lie LOL!!!
Exactly the word buddy but for me since I was a asexual I don't like sweetness
I would choose a ban so i can travel a cross the country buddy by the way you have ban at the same time he got a house
I guess we can forget about that thing buddy im so, so sorry for it because i was a kind of short memory term. Buddy that why i can't help you with that
Oh if i have that kind of money i will invest it into lot
Twist: my dad left when I was 11
Exactly the word buddy because it was a kind of good idea
Ahm i guess it wasn't a spoken because there wasn't a pattern
Yeah i guess it was a good idea after all buddy i Kinda like it anyways
I'm not gonna lie it was on my watch list
There we go again to a lot of numbers I don't like that game anyways. I don't like number like that can i know what was the reason why they are a lot of numbers

Uhh neither, I'm 26, married and have a kid LOL!!!!
Well maybe he was old but mx. Brain doesn't mature enough right now
> If you didn't get as much data as possible, how would you know that you missed something  But like almost everything else in life, this goes both ways. Sometimes you have all the data you really need to make the right decision, but you get even more data that actually steers you away from the right decision.  You're probably thinking..."How could more data steer you into the wrong decision?"  Well my argument, is that on just about any stock in existence, I think you can find an expert analyst that will provide an extremely compelling argument in either direction. An extremely compelling argument to buy or sell the stock.  On just about any stock in the S & P 500. If you only listened to one of these people, you'd think their thesis was an absolute no brainer, and how could you possibly lose? The truth is, neither person is completely right or wrong. They're just focusing on different sets of information, and excluding other sets of information. But if you think having ALL the information is the answer, I would disagree. Unless you have a super powerful AGI that is absorbing ALL the information and then spitting out an percentage guesstimate of where the stock will be in six months.  Regular human brains can only handle so much information, and we already have a ton of built-in biases that's going to color any information we receive.
I went through that, I kept thinking about getting rich overnight getting rich overnight getting rich overnight, chasing crypto, NOT nfts, options, this, that, and the third. Just losing money and failing. Then one day it hit me, and I decided to pick a few stocks that I like (apple Tesla etc etc) and every time I get paid, I just throw a few dollars in them and THAT'S it. Nothing anymore complicated than that. One day I just realized that the name of the game is patience! Now the Market doesn't stress me anymore and I let it do it's thing, on good days and bad. Try it! I think you'll be happy with the results long term!  https://preview.redd.it/vpl2fxfx6y9b1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4f278f5024807eb28262c5c62b194d24b2aa55d6  In comparison, THIS was my portfolio over the two previous years when I THOUGHT I knew what I was doing. 🤣
I've got a wrinkly lumpy pattern on my balls so what
Sometimes? I am talking about consistently making profitable trades, not "sometimes". I get what you are saying, but it sounds erroneous.  IF you want the majority of your trades to make money, you will need to collect all relevant data and make your price predictions based on the data you collect. Me, I do what works for me, I guess you do what works for you. But out of my last hundred trades over 80% were right in terms of predicted direction of price movement, but 60% were wrong due to timing, because I would buy weekly options midweek instead of in a longer time frame trying to save money, an insight identified by looking at my own trading data. So do what works for you.
I'll give it a go, I'm already keeping to stock's I like and staying away from meme stocks. But still seeing x euros go poof always feels a bit strange. Everyone thinks they have a high risk tolerance but until you see money disappear its something else.
Luckily tsmc doesnt make any of nvidias stuff thank god they are safe from invasion
Nvidia CEO feels safe relying on Taiwan for chips  https://www.reuters.com/technology/nvidia-ceo-feels-safe-relying-heavily-taiwan-manufacturing-2023-06-01/#:~:text=Chip%20manufacturer%20Taiwan%20Semiconductor%20Manufacturing,O)%20would%20continue%20to%20diversify..
Me who owns both plus AMD
I don’t understand why people are worried about TSMC being invaded but I am happy to keep collecting these super cheap shares.   NVDA, AMD and also the entire planet are just as fucked as TSMC if this actually happens lol
invasion is already priced in silly
Bruh, just hedge the tsmc position with a raytheon one. Chances are, they both gonna print regard(ed)less.
You realise they are building 2 plants in the USA. With the second one being 3nm which is cutting edge… at which point China invades and USA let’s them.   https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2022/12/06/tsmc-to-up-arizona-investment-to-40-billion-with-second-semiconductor-chip-plant.html
Have you considered the risk of Mexico invading California?
To be fair, the revenue/margin profile of fabs vs. a fabless chip company is totally different.
Just buy ASML. They win in any scenario.
Luckily NVDA makes its own chips, doesn't it?
Why can’t nvidia just buy Taiwan are they stupid
If China invades, all stock will go down 😂
Only the most regarded believe China will invade Taiwan
Do you understand that NVIDIA is completely dependent on TSMC?? TSMC literally manufactures all of their chips.
Tsmc makes their chips (usually)
the invasion of taiwan is in 2026. so in around 2,5 years. but nobody said that mainlanders will win.
You know Nvidia is fucked if TSMC is invaded right? You act like Samsung could fill the void
Screaming buy.  No one is close to TSM.
A: tmcc is currently building out a north American supply chain.  B: it would be national suicide for China to attack Taiwan.   C: tmcc makes chips for nividia.
You are thinking way to much.
Yeah I was shocked when Buffet invested, but he backed right out
If China is willing to risk WWIII to take control TSM, then TSM must be pretty valuable.
Nvidia is currently reliant on the chip manufacturing of TSMC...
NVIDIA is trading on FOMO. The company will never be at  reasonable value
If the invasion happens the entire stock market will do down, TSMC may stay depressed for longer over even indefinitely, but I feel like you could get out in time.
Except NVDA is at a forward PE of 40
You are holding TSMC’s hand in the picture.
WTF! I didn’t realise it was valued so cheaply. I might by a shit load! Invasion happens I’m probably not going to be worried about my stock portfolio, I’m going to hoarding caps and radaway!
Insert skeleton meme for those folks waiting for a chinese invasion of taiwan. You guys actually think china has the capability to do an amphibious invasion 🤣🤣🤣. They're a parade military only capable of thumping their chest and filing complaints.
It’s not just the risk of invasion, it’s that because of the risk of invasion the business will be sourced by a company that doesn’t have the associated risk in the long run.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|18632)![img](emote|t5_2th52|18632)![img](emote|t5_2th52|18632)
Same here, nothing within the reach of China and Russia.
NVDA revenue damn near doubling QoQ and ppl still trying to apply a rear looking PE ratio.
I really want to hop on the NVDIA train, I just don't trust china enough to not invade Taiwan
So once Arizona plant is complete, does price moon for tsmc?
the play is Intel not TSMC.     Biden is ready to money print Intel back to glory by subsidizing its fab planets in NA.     TSMC gets overtaken by China with-in the next decade basically as soon as Intels fab facilities are online in NA.
What if china wants to invade USA? Santa Clara, specifically.
Tsmc were also forced to build chip plants in US even though it’s guaranteed to lose money. So yea, it never hurts to follow buffet.
Bunch of regards.. Tsmc relies on Nvidia!!
Please buy moar NVDA.  Moar moar moar!  Bullish!
I'd rather stick to baking cookies, at least they won't crash my portfolio! 🍪📉
I'd rather eat glue than touch TSMC, and that's saying something!
Don't worry, I promise to keep my hands off TSMC too! We'll form a support group. 😄
This is why I’m long Intel in my IRA
Does anyone have an idea of how an invasion would affect semiconductor stocks?
Someone feed visual mod more gpus
Just get TMC
Avgo-Am I a joke to you?
Absolutely regarded. Biden has already promised to prop up TSMC if they get invaded.
That’s why I’m long chocolate chips
Isn’t it building its factory in Arizona? After it diversified its manufacturing outlets, we can certainly give it a buy😌
This seems like a 🌈🐻 thread
TSMC is expanding into the US.
https://preview.redd.it/1w5vx2dtqy9b1.jpeg?width=1079&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a0cb3c7a0d20ac11e70865a369817ff0eea55319
In the case of invasion all of semi is fucked big dog
I just do SOXL because I am a degenerate with a gambling addiction.
The Taiwan will be invaded the same day the recession arrival propheted by plebbitors for the 100th time.
Till you realize an invasion is going to tank the wntire semi conductor industry ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Just buy FSELX
Forward PE is 40 tbh, but I sold my position @ 403 so yeah
I thought somebody here mentioned closer the company is the user end the bigger the profit margin.
Dude!
This is really good - nice one!
Is nVidia overvalued?   No, its the market that wrong.
Intel in the corner thinking about how nobody else at the party understands that it's excess fab space will hurt TSMC just as much as itself if there is not enough demand.
Lithium Carbonate still lookin' good
Do you know who supplies Nvidia with chips?
I know, why would you want to own the largest manufacturer of the most useful product in existence or has ever existed. Being subsidized by the US government is also a huge turnoff.
Off topic, but I’ve always wondered with this stock photo, are both girls the same model?
Yea, better off going with TSEM as Israel is much more stable 🤐
I don't like TSM as a stock due to high Cap Ex overhead. That being said if there was an invasion by China it'd effect everyone who uses them, including Nvidia.
I've got TSMC in my ROTH. Pretty nice dividend too.
People tend to forget that TSMC has some of their factories here in America. Specifically AZ.
I've owned it for 20 years. I'm good.
Nothing wrong with a stock that makes me money. Not fancy, but it's not a loser.
U all crazy people pe 220 🤦‍♂️ tell me that this is not a bubble…
still like TSMC.. they make majority of semiconductor..   &#x200B;  idk why Buffett got out of it but he made at least 40% on it..   &#x200B;  I'd stick with it man.. just get in at a good margin of safety..   &#x200B;  an invasion would definitely drop that price to my liking though right? lol
If Taiwan got invaded by west Taiwan every stock is dropping
It's not just invasion. Our political system has decided to onshore GPU production and is printing new money to fund that investment.
They building an exact replica factory in US
But you buy BABA.  Why?
P/E ratios ... ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Own both
Is OP a joke?
The funny thing is that TSMC's foreign facilities and core technology alone are worth FAR MORE than their current market cap. So if Taiwan is invaded, your investment is safe, if not, it moons. It's a great price.
This due is dumb as F..... tsmc producs Nvida chips. If China goes in!! By by Nvida production for Short period of time. This equal to short the stock!!! Do your Homework buddy!!
LMAO, this. For unawares Nvidia gets ALL their stuff from TSMC
Why do people keep thinking ccp invasion into Taiwan would only affect SOME stocks lol
I almost choked on my tea 😭😭😂
All their products are linked to ASML and TSMC
TSMC does make nvidia chips..... wth you smoking
China doesn’t need to invade but only need « fair elections »…Taiwan elections are set for January, 13th 2024. Buckle up ![img](emote|t5_2th52|18630)
Stockton Rush felt safe going to the titanic in his submersible
Everyone feels safe until they get punched in the face
This makes it a little safer
China will seize Taiwan. I don't want it to happen but it's a reality. America only has to deter this long enough to start making our own chips. Taiwan will be armed as we armed Ukraine and when china invades it will be bloody, a shit show, and all the chip factories will end up being destroyed accidentally or intentionally.   We will focus on deterrence. Then benefit denial. But I see no future where America offers absolute defense to Taiwan.

Yeah, people not buying TSMC because they worried about invasion should be shorting the entire stock market by the same logic.
Because they only follow this stuff on a very superficial level. TSMC is building an Arizona plant with the backing of the Biden administration. Underlying context: US thinks TSMC is a backable asset and is are to invest in.
My guy is ready to pull out all his positions if the invasion happens.  Flair checks out
💯
Yeah, invasion priced in at 230 PE. Should be 600ish after invasion.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640)
Actually, this is kinda true. Would be $150 to $180 if there was no China drama
Tail risk of that level isn’t priced in. It’s just ignored.
Says 2024 and 2026 to begin producing…thats actually sooner than i thought. Thought it would be like 5-8 years away lol
By the time those come online, N3 will be 2-3 generations old. I’m not saying those plants can’t catch up to home base, but it will take a decade if not more.  If TSMC fabs are destroyed, it will be akin to burning the Library of Alexandria. I would not be surprised if the Taiwan has TSMC fabs rigged with explosives as a form of mutually assured destruction. Human progress will literally be set back by decades, worldwide disruptions in every supply chain and every sector of the economy. China would be very fucked by this as well as the US. The world simply cannot handle the level of semiconductor production capacity loss in a normal way.  Anyway, I am slightly optimistic that it won’t come to this. It is in everyone’s interest that this be negotiated peacefully.
Not the same chips.
All the time, bruh.  The wall was to protect us from Mexico, remember?
yeah ASML is the REAL monopoly here.

Samsung made the chips for the 3xxx series.
You probably don't have to worry about Russia invading outside Ukraine.  The Ukraine war has seriously depleted their military, even if someone peace deal is struck in Ukraine, if they start another war and pull troops from Ukraine, well they might counter attack or sponsor a rebellion in the occupied area
YoY they were down on revenue… one quarter of growth doesn’t show anyone anything. They need to show consistent growth.
Or is Arizona also getting invaded? Puts on Arizona?
I love how most Intel investors base their investment thesis off a possible war
Yes. They all go up.
And Samsung
This might explain why the shares I bought with pocket change in ON a few years ago are up so much
AMD's also, no?

More like Stockton Smush.  Too early?
Amazing. Only a matter of time before China takes Taiwan
Similar to how our Gov’t runs a recession stress test: A passing grade in a hypothetical scenario is nice, but it's the pop quizzes that get you
These are bold claims. Upon what do you base them?
TSMC is building an Arizona plant with the backing of the Biden administration.
Due to standing defense treaties with it sticking to a conventional war china's navy would be systematically destroyed preventing resupply of troops on Taiwan. No doubt it would be wrecked by china couldn't take it over.
Even if this happens, the whole stock market will die. This event is irrelevant to any particular investment decision!
I’ve come across these doomer stories and videos a couple times, then I started actually looking into it. Its on par with the “China / US will collapse in x days!” trash ignoring the dozens of details why its not going to happen. Everyone involved is way too codependent on each other for any of this to happen in at least the next decade.
We won’t be making comparable chips for like 20 years.  The facilities we are building here are not eh advanced nodes that are in Taiwan.  On top of that, tsmc can’t get employees here to even get the facilities up and running.  And if the machines are damaged in Taiwan, they aren’t replaceable.  It takes many years to build those machines and there is a decade long waiting list.  We can’t make our weapons anywhere else, and we don’t want china having access to the chips for weapons or the ability to manufacture AI chips.  We would either defend Taiwan, or bomb tsmc to dust.  And bombing it would be a horrible situation because it would set the world back many years.
Pretty uninformed take 😂
Tell me you have calls on Intel without telling me you have calls on Intel..
Chinese have been threatening to take Taiwan since Mao Zedong in the 50s! He would even laugh about it to his advisors and say it was so easy to get such big reactions out of USSR and USA and keep them busy.   Frankly, the aggressive posture of US right now is fucking embarrassing.   Taiwan has recently been asking US to back off since america doesn’t realize it’s the butt of a joke.   America needs to worry about being a global financial powerhouse pushing for free markets instead of swinging our dick around with this dumb fucking morality police boner we’ve got. Russian sanctions are fucking stupid. China sanctions are fucking stupid. Focus on real issues at home.

wow normies really believe the US can take on China. I had no idea.
Taiwan won’t fight back. Ukraine shows it isn’t worth it just cut a deal and move on
I like all semiconductor stocks.
I don't hate the stock. It's my maybe 5th biggest holding, but I'll be damned if that stock does not give me a near heart attack once or twice a year. I'll buy the dip at $80's or below noise in forums will sound like end of the world.. and sell bit by bit once it comes up again.. rinse and repeat since the past few years.
You hate 681% returns in 5 years....?
Scared money is not always safe
Ok
The math is mathing for once
Yeah you'd have to be a complete regard to believe the SP500 is safe during a Taiwan invasion.  Having that one or two TSMC fabs in the US will lessen the pain somewhat but when the invasion starts everyone will still get fucked.  Some of you will have lube but that's about it.
They are busy buying war stocks  lol
The facility being built in Arizona is not the advanced nodes they have in Taiwan.  On top of that, that facility is years behind because they can’t find qualified employees willing to work for them.
Solyndra says hi.
Paying 15x 2100 earnings! Maybe my grandkids will see a real earnings return?
It’s not that soon, they are year behind now.  Tsmc has recently stated they are far behind the plans because they can’t find workers.
3nm is this year and anything smaller has some pretty difficult engineering to overcome.   Process advances aren’t every 2-3 years. Sure Tsmc made 5nm in 2020 but it’s been worked on for much longer
it is the same chips. 3nm is TSMCs current
Planes exists 🫢

That’s what happens when you use Taiwanese chips. Implosion!
American parts, Russian parts, all made in Taiwan.
What in the fuck is that
The morning you wake up and realize that these mortgage backed securities are dogshit...
It's the Internet where every single person is an expert on every single thing so you know you're getting good information.
Saying that China will invade Taiwan is bold. Reasoning what happens IF invasion happens, will probably have no good outcome for TSMC in any scenario. The technology present at TSMC is not only a necessity for every big-tech company, it is also a military-tech strategic centre of gravity. You could argue that it is easier for a country to start a nuclear war program than reproduce the factories of TSMC that make 2nm chips.  Knowing this, the position of the US is highly ambiguous. They don't want to create conflict with China so they use one China politics, but at the same time don't want China to get acces to the technology, so they arm Taiwan up to the tits.  In case of invasion the US therefore has 2 options: 1. Help defend Taiwan in the same manner as Ukraine with increasing support of arms and money when the winning outcome shifts towards Taiwan, or 2. Blow up all TSMC factories.  In the mean time, it is in the best interest of the shareholder to move operations away from Taiwan to Japan or mainland US. An investment of $40 billion for fabs in Arizona is a start. Every 10% revenue that TSMC generates in either US, Japan, Europe, will most certainly increase the p/e.
Been in the Navy a looong time. If this war lights off it will be my war. It is in my interest to research and know about this shit.
his gaping rectum.
TSMC plan going up in my back yard in AZ as we speak. China wouldn’t dare set foot in US soil.
it's still just 4% of TSMC's total output. whether that's enough for the US I do not know. still lots of challenges.  https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/22/technology/tsmc-arizona-factory-tensions.html  but since inception it's nice to know they are doing the advanced nm , I think originally they were only going to be doing 5nm, but have since added a 2nd phase for 3nm
The US Navy would have to deal with some pretty robust anti ship missile capabilities. The US also has to deal with the thousands of miles to resupply our naval forces. Meaning any new capability that arises in the region, if we develop a countermeasure their is a lag to get it to the front. This is an advantage on china's part.   Can the Chinese navy compete with the US Navy? Not away from their shores, but Taiwan is right in their back yard. A war their will have huge costs to the US military. Huge. We will probably still be able to pull off a strategic victory but the cost would be immeasurable.
China is incapable of invading Taiwan even without the USN intervening. They simply lack the logistical capability to move sufficient troops unless Taiwan completely capitulates and let them dock with converted cruise ships and cargo ships.  The PLA is essentially a defensive military with very little power projection capability. The most they can do is lob a couple thousand missiles at Taiwan and try to bomb them into submission.
Defense stocks will rise
It is talked about in the national security strategy from the Biden Harris admin.
The plant they are building are for the 5nm first phase and the current 3nm second phase. originally it was just the 5nm but they are planning on the 3nm shortly after. whether or not TSMC advances before that we do not know. but currently the most advanced they can produce will be in production here, just at about 4% the volume of their total.
Yeah but the threat of bombing those factories is part of what keeps china away. Benefit denial. Invasion will have a cost of naval assets and personnel. If invasion trigger the destruction of what you are trying to gain why invade? There is no benefit to the cost. So it may set the world back, but it would keep china from challenging the west and strangling our economy while theirs thrives.
So China going to war with Taiwan could effectively set the world 20 yrs back, is that what you're saying? Knowing this China may not attack Taiwan until the US finds a place for TSMC other than Taiwan
In what way.
All i know is china is the jealous ex gf of taiwan who cant get over the breakup
Found the China spy
Militarily? Anyone who thinks they can't is delusional. It's practically the only thing the "America #1" weirdos are right about.   &nbsp;   In any sort of hypothetical "all out" war no country is comparable.    &nbsp;   The only question is would they directly intervene, and the answer is almost certainly not.
Lol china has hilarious skirmishes with India and Pakistan all the time.  Paper fucking tiger. America has a proven trake record of murder
Killing your enemies is almost always worth it. Because they can't try and make more deal later.   Ukraine is showing china that taking over a country isn't fucking easy. Especially for a country with troops that haven't seen combat, ever.   America is really fucking good at murder. It's our main export if you ask me.
If Ukraine is showing anything its that it's not worth invading for China, not that it's not worth fighting back.

A little over 100%! I don’t check my portfolio often so I was surprised it was up that much.

B- But… but *everyone* pays their mortgage!
It’ll be interesting to see how commercial real estate transitions
It doesn't matter if there's an invasion. US and Europe are onshoring chip fabrication as fast as humanly possible just in case.
Also, the people of Taiwan want to remain separate from China. They will fight with everything they've purchased from the USA and probably destroy the country rather than give any bit of it to the Chinese.
lolz @ 'trust me, i'm a squid.'  fucking semen.
K Mr seaman. Maybe china will take Taiwan, maybe not. If they do attempt to invade by force they're fucking stupid or they just don't care about the massive blood price they'd have to pay. It would be an absolute catastrophic loss of life and resources on their side. Modern invasion of a small island defended by a modern army of 160k is folly, with many more trained civilians (1m+). Theres a 1000 miles of coast line and even then, most of that is not accessible and can't be invaded. Taiwan is a very mountainous and lots of coastline is just cliffs. The only reasonable way to take the island is to reduce it to ash from afar. I doubt the US would hang them out to dry either, would most likely send aid /sell surplus like Ukraine.
Thought they’d already bought up all the soil
hey, pretend or real navy guy... you know that taiwan is a heavily fortified, mountainous island, right?  with only ~2 viable beachheads.  and china has basically shit by way of amphibious assault?  so what are they going to do - try to rely on paratroopers after attempting to take down their air defense in surgical strikes/attrition?  or just blow taiwan up and defeat the purpose?  ccp WANTS taiwan.  a razed taiwan doesn't do them any good.
As we pay retirees to build more weapons.
Yeah, their job is to consider every possible scenario of geopolitical and economic fallout to position and prevent it. Same as the other 2 involved parties. If they didn’t care about it, that might be a bit more concerning for unpredictable outcomes.
2nm will be coming in a few months with the next iPhone.  And either way, even if they get 3nm online here, it’s going to be years.  They already recently said they are very very behind plans.
are you actually this stupid?  not only would our economy be strangled, but most of the world's.  taiwan makes the majority of the world's chips and damn near all of the cutting edge chips.  and why would the usa bomb tsmc?  tsmc already said they'd destroy their own fabs before letting the prc have them.  also, how/why would china's economy thrive?  china ALSO depends on taiwan, genius.  their economy isn't even thriving now.
😂
We will kill you in your sleep on Christmas and Easter Day.  And then the other 363 days left in the year.
Taiwanese are rich, soft and few in number. Ukrainians are poorer, tougher and come from a more martial culture. The mayor of Kiev is Vitali fucking Klitschko.
Yup, MBLY included even if for different reasons
Its most advanced node at that moment. They alreasy have a more advanced node than that one.
Transistor size, 3nm is like this year technology and anything smaller causes a heap of engineering problems to solve (leakage blah blah.. go look it up). Apples best current chip is 5nm and 99% of all chips currently use 5nm. There is rumours the A17 might go to 3nm. It’s very current technology.   Tsmc facilitates the creation of chips based on engineering spec. It’s not like they create the die designs for the A17. Apple does from my knowledge but I’m honestly not upto date with this.
Yes they love that defense spending, and things that will increase defense budgets. Hot war with China.. that may be real bad for business, depending on how things play out.
Minimum PE I want is 5in
They can just do bailouts at our expense
That's semen recruit to you.
I agree, it has potential to be one of the most devastating losses of live ever. May even spark the biggest war man kind has ever seen.   I hope it never pops off. But china is acting like they want to take Taiwan, even if force is required, and the Pentagon is taking that shit deadly serious.
Just the west coast and parts of NY. AZ is fine. Better bet is Texas.
They don't need to storm the whole island. They can just blockade it. Starving people tend to cut deals for food. And china has enough proximity to maintain a naval presence there.   Again taking Ukraine as an example let's not underestimate leaders willingness to raze shit to the ground.
"ccp WANTS taiwan"  &#x200B;  big assumption here.
We literally pulled out of Afghanistan to regroup our military and decrease strain on the forces. You know just in case.   I understand that war with China is not a certainty. But the risk is there and very real.
No the Iphone 15 will be 3nm. maybe Iphone 17 will be 2nm later. TSMC doesn't plan on 2nm production until 2025. but even still 20 years is quite the exaggeration. Arizona they expect 2026 for 3nm, even if pushed back let's say 2030. Like I said previously the plant was originally intended for just 5nm, 3nm is great to have as a 2nd phase.
I didn't say who would be doing the bombing. China would thrive by projecting POWER. not economic, but real power. Defeat the world's best military? That's some big dick energy. That increases your sphere of influence. That gets people to want to play on your team and make trade/defense agreements.
The madlad.   How’s ya blood pressure?
This is true. Just look at Russia and Ukraine. Ukraine produces most of the world's wheat. The Russians would sooner raze the entire country and burn the fields just to take it under their control. China could likely do the same to Taiwan. It's the idea that if I can't have it nobody can. I wouldn't play chicken with China on that one. Best to ramp up production here domestically and become independent rather than rely on such a volatile situation in the east.
using ukraine as an example is MY point though - to say it's gone terribly for russia is far beyond an understatement.  i don't know that their navy is really good enough to blockade taiwan, or that they'd want to commit such suicide.  that would likely force action from s korea, japan, australia, and others in the region.  if not the usa... and what would china do, shoot at those intervening and start a war they can't win?
China has never recognized Taiwan's independence. Not only do they want it, but they have openly demanded it.
Excellent
no what I meant is they want to secure their borders, correct their humiliating history, and display a strong military front to the world. They don't care about taiwan itself, they care about what it represents. They will raze taiwan, and if takes 1,000,000 chinese soldiers to do it thats a price they are willing to pay.

Yes, it's an absolute layup the market is going higher this month. You would have to be regarded to short here. Might as well spend your money on something enjoyable. Trust me the market is not going down this month. Every dip or red day is a buying opp.
To be fair, we've had approximately 9% inflation since the last all time high (using CPI as an estimate). So, adjusted for purchasing power, all time highs is 9% down.
According to my very advanced calculations, the market will hit a new record high sometime in history.  Source: [Looking at a table of S&P 500 returns](https://chooseinvesting.com/calc/historical-index-returns#table-of-returns)

If you sold at 10.91 and lost money you would no longer be able to take that loss as a deduction because you repurchased the same company within 30 days. Whether or not you will owe taxes on the shares you bought at 10 depends entirely on  the price when you eventually sell those.
We’re getting taxed on losses now? I am FUCKED
This regard asking more regards about financial planning
If you sold the shares @ 10.91 for a loss, than you would be unable to write off the loss because it would a wash sale.
You can be my friend.
You generally pay taxes on any gains from the sale, because you're on this board I'll assume that you sold at a loss therefore you owe no taxes on the transaction and the purchase doesn't matter.
If you made a profit when you sold at $10.91 then it is not a wash sale and you owe taxes on your profit. If you sold at a loss then you cannot deduct that loss on your taxes but TDA should add the loss to the cost basis of the $10 per share purchase.
31 days between the trade dates. But since you sold high and bought low it really won't matter.
Lol
I'm going off a complete hunch here, so if this isn't news to you then  I apologize.  You should make sure you understand the Pattern Day Trading limitations and requirements. You also need to make sure you understand how settlement of funds works, and make sure you are able to trade on **unsettled funds**.  If you call your broker up on the phone some twenty two year old Tanner / Chad snot will help you learn all this stuff.
This guy fucks. Fuck you, and, congratulations
Yes. Have to pay for the wash sale. Idk what the amount you're gonna have to pay but it's happened to me before on bonds. I made money though. Instead of lost. I think you can make more money sometimes but it's illegal.
Pretty sure you only pay tax on income. 91 cents per a share. Be like 15 cents each or something.

Fellow regards. We got him
There are two sides to any trade A buy and a Sell  You can do either first
Its,fake they lying saying u won't get credit then it will reduce ur basis on shares u buy
dis aint car wash
LOL stop dude
Nope it's a wash sell and I have sufferered from it as well
If you sold 3k shares for 10.91 and bought the same shares back for $10, then you made a profit of $0.91 x 3000 = $2730 minus trading fees if TD Ameritrade charges any. You may need to withhold taxes depending on your situation. It is not a wash sale unless you’d run a loss on the same stock less than 30 days earlier.  BTW, do you know if its the exact same shares you bought back, or were they similar looking shares?
lmao this sub would be bankrupt
That’s it ? What about the shares I bought back @ $10.00
Thanks , makes sense!
May not be this way for everybody, but Schwab seems to bake wash sales directly into the cost basis column when viewing basic position details.
Thanks
It might not be, since we don’t know the cost basis of the shares he sold for $10.91 if he sold for profit then it isn’t a wash sale. Wash sale only applies to losses.
Implying it isn't already? ![img](emote|t5_2th52|12787)
If you sell the shares @ 10.00 for a loss, than you will be unable to write off that loss because it would be a wash sale -- unless you wait 30 days before selling.
For some reason I read it that he sold at one broker and then repurchased at TDA. You’re correct. I’ll edit.
This.
If OP couldn't figure this out, he/she may be a bit too highly regarded even for wsb.
It's a holiday so I'll share....  Reddit has their own "anti-hate" team that will scour posts and automatically suspend accounts that use harrasing or hateful words.  We even had a guy suspended after a mod mail convo where we were all joking about the mods' sexual preferences.  The mod team (Zjz, that sexy beast) has put a filter on WSB so anyone using our decade old colloquial terms will simply have their comment auto-deleted before Reddit discovers it and suspends their account.  So, instead of being able to directly call out plays of questionable mental ability, we now call them "regarded".
#It’s slang Retarted bc Sensorship
It's the French word for our Mongoloid brethren
Truely regarded
just look around. everyone on wsb is a regard lol
I’m so glad you say this because if you looked at my search history tonight you would find “what is a stock market regard” “what does regarded mean in stockmarket “ and I’ll tell you what I was no fucking closer to anything except the bottom of my wine

Psychomotor retardation can have several effects on cognitive abilities. Here are some common ways in which psychomotor retardation may impact cognitive functioning:  &#x200B;  1. Slowed thinking: Psychomotor retardation can result in a slowing down of mental processes, including thinking. It may take longer for individuals experiencing psychomotor retardation to generate ideas, make decisions, or solve problems. Their cognitive processing speed may be noticeably reduced. 2. Impaired concentration: The slowed mental processes associated with psychomotor retardation can make it difficult for individuals to maintain focus and concentrate on tasks. Attention may wander, and sustaining attention for extended periods of time may be challenging. 3. Reduced mental flexibility: Psychomotor retardation can lead to a decreased ability to shift attention and adapt to changing situations. Individuals may find it harder to switch between tasks or adjust their thinking based on new information. This can affect problem-solving abilities and the ability to adjust strategies as needed. 4. Memory difficulties: Slowed cognitive processing can impact memory functions. Retrieving information from memory may take longer, and individuals may experience challenges with working memory, which is involved in holding and manipulating information temporarily. This can affect learning, recalling information, and following complex instructions. 5. Speech and language difficulties: Psychomotor retardation can also affect speech and language abilities. Slowed mental processes can lead to delayed or sluggish speech production, difficulty finding words, or reduced fluency. Expressing thoughts and ideas verbally may require more effort and time.
A true regard.
It's when you "work at the back of Wendy's" too much and your index finger is indefinitely curved into the ideal stroke shape and can't reach the "T" key when you are typing so you hit the "G" key instead.

Its a cool way of calling someone a genius...it's inside lingo here;)
OP is too REGARDED not figuring this out.![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640)
Censorship is cool.
All these responses have answered the questions I never had to ask. It was obvious from day 1 that regarded was just a passable way to say something that we all think, but now have to cloak in another term to satisfy the overlords of societal standards. Just think, someday we will all be the same, we will own nothing, nothing will be offensive, and we will all be thankful for it. /s
Find a mirror and look into it. You will see one fat regard
You see pre-GME before the sub was flooded by normies from shit subs like r/politics or r/all. Banter was loose and fun.  Then the normies got their fee-fees hurt by all the sophomoric content on here. So dumb ass words like apes and regards is what we have to use now. And those same twats gladly carry the name ape, they ruined this sub. Quick run down of why/how this sub turned to shit for a while there.
Imagine if they banned the use of the word regarded, and it was replaced with a new word. You could cycle through the English language until mods ban every word, reductio ad absurdum.
They made a movie about us, and now, we can't even swear or use the same words we did before.  In the beginning, this Reddit was a living, breathing, Wolf of Wallstreet party 24, 7.  Now, it's much more like a Sears board meeting.
I've been banned here twice, once for like two weeks.  Bet we can't even make fun of the PLTR guys hair anymore.
No regard can answer this!!
Don’t worry, I had to look it up as well.   Basically the teenage boys that dominate Reddit demographics don’t understand that many people find the R word offensive. Instead of listening to the ID community when they say the R word is a slur, Reddit has decided they would like to keep using the word but have found a work around (ie calling themselves regarded).
Replace the G with a T and you have your answer. Prior to reddit snapping down on hate speech those words were thrown around all over WSB. It was part of the community to throw around hate speech at each other for options plays we would share with one another. It used to be hardcore locker room banter.  IIRC even the acronym FD, which referes to options with very little time left till expiration, was short for Fa**ots Delight. WSB just finds ways to avoid getting banned by reddits TOS so you end up with this.
Years ago I was on aol chat room whatever it was for the first time. I asked what lol meant and I though every one was laughing at me for asking. A real who's on first situation for sure.
You are regarded
Regarding your cars extended warranty
Sounds like something a regard would say
retardant minus the 🐜
Typical regarded question
I thought it was self-explanatory
It's a euphemism for a less polite word. Hint: the word is an anagram for "trader", which is awesome, especially for WSB

Dear Reddit team,   If you have a rule against using a word, and your rule can be circumvented by swapping out one letter, and everyone still knows what it means and is using it for the original purpose, you just may be the most regarded people in this app.   Sincerely,   A massive regard
it comes from the french verb for « to look »

Anti-hate teams are highly regarded.  One of the many reasons I will short the Reddit IPO.
Ahh I see you are an acoustic user of the sub
Pour one out for the regarded people on this sub
“Anti-hate” is camouflaged censorship. We all should be able to call one another whatever names desired. If your feelings get hurt, you’re the problem. WSB going Disney level woke.
Also autocorrect helped turn reta-ded into regarded too. Seamless transition for the dummies here that can barely spell.

highly regarded comment
Ffs Your comment should of been “no one tell him”
How can this guy just say it?! Tarts are forbidden snacks.
Using a banned word that is a considered a derogatory word for those of questionable intelligence, while misspelling censorship is peak WSB
lol sensorship.  Are we measuring temperature?
We like the term " special" when posting DD that came straight from the anus
I never understood though, is it because we're not supposed to point out someone's (in our case each other's) lacking mental abilities, or because calling each other by the name that's used to describe those who have deficiencies, would offend those with diagnosed deficiencies? Like kinda saying your pronouns are this/that is offending those who have non obvious pronouns.  Either way, complicated world. Nothing for a regard.
That’s racist

Shame on OP for asking the question
Replace the G with a T and you have your answer. WSB prior to the gamestop hype was mostly people insulting each other with the equivalent of hate speech for sharing Options plays and questionable TA. Reddits changing TOS has forced users to find ways to get around it.  Even the beloved acronym FDs which wsb uses to refer to options with very short expiration. Stands for Fa**ots Delight.

Eh, i find the word lacking taste, but ive also worked with a lot of people with autism. I dont think you're the problem if you have autism and you're not super stoked on people calling each other idiots using the term that they'd also use for you.   Im not a big fan of ultra woke culture, but i do think it is a 'pendulum has swung too far' type of issue, not a 'we should be able to say anything we want' type of problem.   But if you think I'm a woke piece of trash, i respect your opinion.

No he didn’t, look at spelling
It’s said a lot in some other subs, but apparently WSB was being targeted by main reddit mods for it.
It was nice knowing him. We will remember him fondly in our hearts 🥰   Especially when he creates a new account
Also, it's spelled wrong. That's likely why the bot didn't pick up on it.

Reddit’s automoderation is just quite niggardly with the words it allows. It’s a real chink in their armor, leading to all sorts of gobbledygook being posted.   I’m going to have to smoke a f@g after this. Yes, that’s the word the auto moderator hates.
Local hundrednaire Wendy’s worker believes that a substantial rise in inflation is imminent, as evidence by the increase in rents.
Poor guy is desperate for rates to drop
Is there actual data that say rents down?
local crackhouse with bullet riddled walls going for 2,000 monthly, now only 750. bring your own shovel....
Yea and billionaire/investor is really all you need to know about a person to know they are always right
Rent where?
What do billionaires know anyway, a few went down in the titanic sub and one just died in a race car accident.
Decline in rents? Where?  I will move out of my current overpriced place asap!!
An article from April 2023? Nice job regard.
🤣
The real ghost is commercial rentals.  All those skyscrapers are empty.
Rents gone down? Where? My shit kept going up. Now I’m hood rich
USA can be like Australia, import 1% of its population a year in immigrants. Make sure they are rich though, so that they can buy the median price of $1M of Sydney houses
I only consult billionaires for my deep sea submarine dives!

A decline in rents? hes wrong im still coleasing with my 50 friends behind Wendy's dumpster
Maybe commercial rents?
I need a substantial drop in mortgage rates myself. 😂😂😢😢😢
Decline in rents? Lol
It’s like being water boarded, but getting that gasp of air in the middle. Perspective *

Translation: Buy the top
Bears are so triggered rn.
Decline in rent where?  Not in Cincinnati Dayton Columbus or Cleveland
Where tf are rents declining? I’ve been looking for a new apartment for a year and they’re still going up despite a 10% population drop in my city
Billionaire Barry is just stating the obvious. The rent data is a year old by the time it lands in the CPI calculation. You can find real time data on rent all over the place so connect dot A to dot B. Rents aren't plateauing where I live, but they are in the sunbelt.
Rent data lags bc leases are annual.  Aoartmentlist and other data shows a decline  OER is used in PCE. Housing in PCE dropped significantly last week. I agree with the rich guy
Maybe owners equivalent rent, which is a joke  Guys, why not not be a moron for once and think a year ahead? Inflation is going nowhere
This guy is delusional. Where are these rent decreases? I sure as hell didn't get one
Guy looks like an old wrinkled cock
Wouldn’t lower rent mean more spending elsewhere?
[removed]
Decline in rent? Nice way of describing a mere slowdown of increases.
What is he smoking?
Rents aren't going down in the way they say. It's similar to how we all don't have stimulus money from two years ago still with us. What it clearly signifies is that rich money is in fucking trouble and they need a rate cut, which honestly has been obvious since jpow started. I remember cries from Elon and Kathy about deflation and my God I hope they get their nightmares. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Rent is dropping. That's news to me!
My rent recently got increased 10%. This article is bullshit
Rents are going down, it’s just not the narrative Reddit wants.
Lol I just increased the rent on my unit by 9% I understand that my metro is one small place in the whole country but still. Lol
Where the hell is rent in decline? Just because companies aren’t paying there building leases doesn’t mean families aren’t still getting fleeced on rent.
I am sure he is unable to rent his 50 million dollar home for 500k a month and has to instead settle down for 495k. Yes! Inflation is coming down./s
When the loans start back up half the consumer market is going to have no buying power so I'm sure the recession that is going to causes will reduce inflation, but it's not going to be any better for the majority of people.
Yea-because Landlords have finally met their income goals and want to lower rent to reduce inflation for the good of everyone else.   Press X to Daut.
I mean hes a realestate mogul who needs rates to drop so he doesnt lose billions, but thats just my take. As always the fed will get the data late and react even later, causing a problem that makes regular folks lose their jobs.
Wait, rents are going down? Where?! 'Cause where I am, a shitbox in a horrible part of the city has gone up twice in the past year.
What decline in rent
Haha, 7 years on WSB and this comment wins? Congrats, you're our very own Wall Street prophet!
This article is from April. Why don’t you post Lincoln’s obituary while you’re at it ?
Just raised rents on all my properties.
Just raised rents on all my properties.
Decline in rents? Rent in CA is going up lol.
Certainly not due to any decline in my monthly rent… just up another 100$ like every year.
Yeah guys, you know the drops in rent. You guys know what I’m talking about don’t you the fact that rent is getting cheaper. I can’t believe how affordable housing is now
There might be a decline in rents but who gives a shit? You pay your rent regardless of what any average or data shows. Just like unemployment, you are or not and the unemployment rate means shit because it doesn't apply at local level. I will admit I'm regarded but there is some truth to this.
The next part will be rate cut timing and when, if JP pulls this off dude is gonna be an all timer!
Weird how every single apartment I looked at in two states rents increased the last 6 months.
Someone owes me a handy and a sprite!  Google you regards.  *Nationwide, rents declined 1% from a year earlier in May−the largest drop since 2020−as a building boom increased supply and economic uncertainty cooled demand, according to Redfin.*
Rents down my fooking arse ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
this is 3 months old, geniuses.
Commercial office space rent is declining in some markets. In unrelated news, there’s been been a surge in editorial articles in mainstream publications about how WFH is now “bad for you”
Rents are going down? Lol. Decline of 1 percent nationally after a 17 percent rise over last year = a massive rent increase
My rent damn sure didn't decline!
Lmfao "the decline in rents". The dude seems more like a comedian than an investor.
What decrease in rent prices is this fuck talking about? Once these TikTok real state investors shit the bed, then I’ll start believing.  BOOM!
I believe him because he has my best interest.
How much of that is commercial vs residential, Barry?
Where? Definitely nowhere near where I live.
rent? mother fuka , my rent in texas just went up $250 ... f
Price of a blowjob behind the dumpsters are up 20%
He’s worth at **least** $350. $750 after next pay day.
This guy finances
Pennyaire under the bridge also agrees
Nailed it. Think this is a part of the financial media most people forget: rich people aren’t giving you free advice, they’re attempting to push a narrative most favorable to their book.
The lion, the witch, and the audacity of this bitch I swear.
We also see a 3% increase in 2022. How does this show rent drilling?
No.  No there is not.
High end home prices have fallen a point or two.
Rents are down across the board here in Las Vegas. Not sure about other markets.
Down 0.1% in one county of Oklahoma and they're feeling bullish on the country's rental prices.
He heads up a gigantic company with offices and properties everywhere, probably has a very good idea of at least corporate rent.
Lower inflation = increasing at a slower rate. Deflation = decline. Nothing is going down. The Fed hates deflation.
Yes. Numerous higher frequency measures of shelter inflation have been drilling since mid-2022.   https://sites.psu.edu/inflation/  https://www.apartmentlist.com/research/national-rent-data  https://www.corelogic.com/intelligence/us-single-family-rent-growth-continues-yearlong-descent-in-april-corelogic-reports/  The shelter lag is why inflation took so long to show up in the first place and is why the transitory idea was bullshit from the jump.
hell no rents aren't down. I'm seeing bedrooms, not 1 bedroom apartments, but just a rented room with shared accommodations starting at $600 and going all the way up to $1200
Actually, rent prices are up due to increase in mortgage rates :( Higher interest rates lead to higher rent prices.
Yes but like housing always does—it depends on location. Most are flat or still going up.
I think this is like that Succession scene when Logan Roy asks his kids what the price of a gallon of milk is and none of them can answer lol
“Nationwide, rents declined 1% from a year earlier in May−the largest drop since 2020−as a building boom increased supply and economic uncertainty cooled demand, according to Redfin.”  Fuck, this is a Wendy’s…
Rent growth is down. Rents are not.
Maybe rich neighborhood? Lol
Commercial rents maybe
Damn this comment should be ranked higher.  Especially since the headline says “imminent.” I guess it has aged like milk since.
This already happens in all major cities
That fucking OER is such a piece of shit, especially now. What idiot is going to say that they couldn't rent their place for more than their mortgage, even though that is probably the case for almost anyone who bought a house from late 2021 forward?
It’s going to be like 3.5% after June data? That’s only a bit off target. I’ll bet it’s closer to 2% rather than 9% this time next year.
We’re down 20% here, different markets I guess!  Now you can get a handy and a small drink for $19.99+Tax.
You get paid for blowjobs?!
Exactly. Everyone knows TikTok is where the real financial advice comes from.
Where are these declining rents he speaks of?
Depends on who that rich person is but yeah, majority of them aren’t trying to help ppl w their “advice”
Same as everyone else
Bars 🔥
Exactly, rent has been increasing over the last 3 years sometime each quarter.  Have yet to interact with anyone who stated their rent decreased.  Most instead are evicted.
😆
AdjectiveNoun####
Yes. Yes there is.  [https://twitter.com/JosephPolitano/status/1668598731128598532](https://twitter.com/JosephPolitano/status/1668598731128598532)
Well, think about those unfortunate wealthy people with low 9 figure net worths. They could be at risk of dropping into the high 8 figure range.  Imagine the horror that entails?! Better go petition the Fed to lower rates again…
Very off topic, but I was looking at a move there pre pandemic, only to get priced out when every two bedroom with a pool went up by +$200k.  Been eyeing it again, but it’s kinda hard to gauge based on just Zillow. Do you happen to have any insight on what a 2 bedroom condo might run in one of the high rises? It’s easy to lookup sale prices, but I tend to think a lot of rentals don’t make it to Zillow.
No, these dweebs on Reddit for sure have a better idea of the current climate on the ground.
Rent has actually been falling a bit. Check the Zillow rental index.
Second link (if I math correctly this morning) shows a 27% increase in rent from 2018 to 2022. We also see a 3% increase in 2022. How does this show rent drilling?    BLS stats on weekly pay from 2018 to 2022 shows a 19% increase in median pay (yearly average) from 2018 to 2022.   Hope you have a nice locked mortgage.
Lol anecdotal evidence is what you say to your friends and family in RL, on the Net you never use it.   The truth: Nationwide, rents declined 1% from a year earlier in May−the largest drop since 2020−as a building boom increased supply and economic uncertainty cooled demand, according to Redfin.
It’s funny how many people walk around thinking their right when they’re wrong and all it takes is 5 seconds to Google but for whatever reason the juice is never worth the squeeze to them.  Nationwide, rents declined 1% from a year earlier in May−the largest drop since 2020−as a building boom increased supply and economic uncertainty cooled demand, according to Redfin.
But those cities don’t have enough $1M properties. So need more immigrants
I think feds over corrected and we will be seeing 1.9% by next year before a return to 2.1%.
Tree fiddy
*<Whispers> “I’m too old for TikTok.”*
Shhh..
My clock gives me financial advice?
Just starting, but should pick up. https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/26/economy/us-rents-may/index.html  Regardless, they will remain much higher than they were 2-3 years ago.
More deceleration than decline. Market/listed data moves faster than BLS surveys.    https://wolfstreet.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/US-CPI-2023-05-22-Zillow-ZORI-v-CPI-OER-YOY.png
Agree with you. However, it’s not prefaced that way though. CNBC has even cut back on disclosing when people have positions.
Sorry, I don’t have a Twitter account.  And Nitter is not working.
Well they looked up rentals on Zillow recently so who is really informed here?
We are in 2023, dawg.   Do you see that swan dive on the graph? The point has never been for the Fed to press the economy into deflation. A deflationary spiral is what caused the Great Depression. The Fed is trying to achieve price stability, not revert back to 2018.
How dare you actually read the links. You are just supposed to accept there's links and that is evidence enough.     The lion, the witch, and the audacity of this bitch I swear.
3% is almost a return to J Pows target 2% rate.  That's significant disinflation from the past few years.
I actually think you're right, hopefully the credit tightening has not completely locked up the consumer.   It's getting close.
Lmfao spit out my beer
Thank you for not saying ‘disinflation.’  “It’s like inflation, but only a tiny bit less!!”
Its a chart that shows the Zillow apartment rent index lagged 1 yr and CPI. The Zillow data indicates rent CPI has peaked and will be falling in every subsequent CPI print for a while. This is why for like a year, CPI vastly underestimated inflation. Now CPI is over estimating inflation.
Yeah, I love gauging inflation by asking rents. Some place that has been listed for two months at +20% over market? Great indicator you got there.
Did they also checked the gold price by going to Tiffany's?
You're getting downvoted because you're right, and disputing people's priors. Lol.
Facts 💯 there won’t be a crash. It will spread out over several months   Nobody tryna listen tho smh
2023 is currently at 2.4%, same second article.   I agree. There is a slowing in the rate increases, which is definitely necessary.  Since it is still increasing, it cannot be drilling - increasing slower yes but not decreasing (drilling) as you stated.
You guys are actually regarded  All the guy pointed out was the yoy price changes are waaay down. And hes right. The articles showed that.
Going from 9% down to 3% is a bfd, in fact within the course of less then a few years makes it even better.  Of course the agenda isn’t to be happy with results, just to complain it’s not good/fast enough.
So overshoot is built into the system.
Zillow is joke data.
These people don't understand that a trend like that is really hard to reverse.   Those graphs are not looking like a soft landing at the moment. The Fed needs to start pulling up on the stick pretty soon, otherwise the goddamn plane is going to crash into the side of the goddamn mountain.
U mad falala
Yeah pretty much.
It has to do with the way inflation is calculated and how rent works. CPI takes the average rent, which for the majority are locked into one year or longer contracts at the previous price, not the current market rent of new rentals.  So when rent increases rapidly, it doesn't show up for a year or longer on the CPI till the renewals hit(plus some states have rent increase caps). The vice versa is also true.
People don't seem to understand that inflation is compounding so saying it's declining when it's still growing is fairly disengenuous.       That's like arguing with a cop giving you a DUI because you are over a 0.08 that you may have blown a 0.12 but when you left the bar you were for sure a 0.16, so it's fine, it's all fine.       Inflation compounds, it's not linear. Maybe we need a hard landing, people are stupid as shit and won't stop spending on everything under the sun despite almost a year of the government on hands and knees telling people to slow spending.
The rate of inflation is declining. Yes it’s still inflation, so that means prices up. It’s not disingenuous to say inflation is declining, because it is.
Inflation is a feature of fractional reserve banking, it is inextricably baked into the system and is what provides the impulse to grow.   If there was zero inflation, the US would turn into Japan.
TIL people on WSB think ascending is declining.
See how easy it is? You literally didn’t have to do anything.
GTFO of here. Held 2 years?! Did not sell and buy calls to make it all back in 1 week. That, sir, belongs in r/investing. I find your post offensive.
Jesus u ve been watching ur shit being red for two years??!  Thats a true believer i hope u average down while waiting
May the gains ride with you 🚀🚀
Why didn't you write options contracts to make money while you were holding your shares ?
Congrats and fuck you
This smells like investing
Good job, felt sorry for those that bought Tesla on that 2021 run up, then Elon bought Twitter lmaooo.
Double down
TO DA MOON BABY!!!!!!
Lmao ppl think buy and hold is that simple.   Be honest OP, how high was your blood pressure throughout this ordeal? How many underwears got dookie stains on them?  I’m not sure whether to congratulate you or tell you to scram to the investing sub.  Regards, 🫡
Congrats for patience!
It's not bagholding if you believe in the company and deduce that the fundamentals are strong.
It’s not a loss until you sell
Good for u, now sell and short so u can experience the same feeling for the next two years. Can have that winning feeling last to long, not if u want to stay in this group
Sell
you didn’t even DCA now that’s regarded
No taxes
sell.
It’s incredible what the stock does considering the cars suck ass
Sell or you might be sorry again
That's 7 covered calls you could have been selling to lower your cost basis.
And so it begins again. More to come.
I’m guessing you probably won’t sell
Bruhhhh, why wouldn't you write covered calls? 700 shares 7 options $10 to $20 otm weeklies easy $3k to $5k a week depending on the strike over a 2 year period that's roughly $150k a year at least, your average could have been near zero by this point
Right? I had put a good portion of my 401 in it at $240 a share, topped at $401 and died and I just sat there kicking myself lol
Congrats, you've escaped the "red"! Time to join the "moon" party! 🚀
congrats for not being a paper hands
Congrats! Your commitment paid off, now go and treat yourself to some Tesla-themed bubble bath! 🚀🛁
Quitter
Congratulations! 🎉 Your patience paid off, and now you're free from the "red" world of $TSLA!
Nice 🤑
Sell
Ayyye I'm in this boat
 Bro bought @ the top. Regard
Bro that's so long that I see this as a losing trade overall even though it's in the green
Got out of the red too this week, unbelievable really.
I doubled my stake when it was at 145....   I've been in the black for a while after that move, this latest run up has been the cherry on top
Well not really cause of opportunity cost.
Atta boy! That’s what it’s all about! It ain’t a loss unless I sell, right?!?
For now
Damn, dude.   Learn how to trade. PLEASE.  You had to so many opportunities to cut your losses, go short, and then go back to being long.
For a wonderful CAGR of 0%!
until earnings when it sinks
You probably bought mine for dollars on the penny ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)
I held nans bag, she gave me 20 bucks
This is crazy, 2 years of not having gains
Hope you got an exit strategy, we are in a pretty volatile market.
Bought at 270, but not in the 100s...  Pussied out and had to put some extra weight on those bags...  Or did you start buying when it already run up to 400 and dca'd?   Don't know what would be worse.
Buy more to celebrate!
...hellow good day. ...luck for day ...
/...hellow good day. ...luck for day ...
Warren would be proud of you
Where my $PYPL boys at?
Yeah, 2 years now put the inflation into the equation and realize that you're still at lost
💎👐
How dare you not gamble that 222k into SPY 0DTE and lose it all?? I’m here to see loss porn. Not gains lmao
So you bought more right now then, right op?!
Clearly, that’s a sign to buy more
2 whole years?! How did you ever manage?!
name of the game !
Gonna do the right thing now and sell or bag hood again and lose all your money?
Should have bought more when low to cost average
This is something the cultists refuse to admit. You can still get raped by ghey bears even while holding TSLA unless you get in at the right time. It's will rip your face off in both directions. Take your gains and get out OP because it is almost time to dump again. Cathy has already started selling.
Guys, i think we’ve just lost a monkey
Take profits and save yourself
Nice it’s not bag holding it’s investing it’s only bag holding if it’s a bad company
Congratulations
Same!
Maybe trailing stop loss this time? Or is that to big brain for here?
Wtf😂 2%😩
Why didn't you sell calls the whole time? Two years of doing the wheel on TSLA you EASILY could've doubled your money, even if you got 1% of the total value of your shares per week, that's 104 weeks, so 104%, and typically with Tesla options cost more than shares so it could've easily been 2-3% a week
Now adjust that for inflation in the past 2 years. Still losing
The real problem is he didn’t take a 30% gain two years ago 😂
Please sell out now and break even so that TSLA may fly up another 4,200%
Anyone think rivan is going to pull a Tesla type of squeeze this year?
Nah, too early bro. $TSLA still has a lot of "gas" in it  ;)
Elite bag holder 💪🏼
Now do in real terms
Congratulations. I am 1 year in having bought tilray. Thought I am after the hype... Yet no I am not.
What are your next great investment ideas?
You could have been selling covered calls on you shares all that time and lowered you entry price 10-20% since Tesla has high IV.
Wait, it didnt go to zero...?
2 years of missed opportunity   Diamond hands ftw
Never sell.. ever
A buddy bought $77k in long Tesla options that he just finally got even on.   He is hanging on to them now (Jan 2024 Exp? I think) and buying $70k more now. He's a glutton for punishment. Lmao
Ok now learn about stop loss orders
CONGRATS, I hope you didn't sell. Or at least hold on to 500 of those shares. Or sell some covered calls if you're willing to give some up.
Damn, good job 👍 if you buy the right stock, don’t worry about down side just hold for longer 😊
Top signal confirmed
That means it's time to buy more.
Learn how to write covered calls.
I'm still down a little but I'm extremely happy with this huge comeback.  I have to say my shares of NVDA helped. DCA all in on TSLA 120 shares at 320
Playing long finally pays off
Ditto
Sell.
I hope this does not come off as smug, but if the position gets closer to $500k, I will give >$1,000 to some of the top comments.  I am not sure on the exact amount.  I simply want to give back and maybe even help other people (here) along the way.
Same with CCL
Still not green for me
Yeah, just have enough money to where you can hold a couple hundred thousand dollars worth of equity that's underwater until the market flips your bags from red to green.  Simple, really.
Just gently weep himself to sleep each nite.
Yeah you’re right.
I'm at +1054% on tesla, been holding those bad boys since Feb 2018. Can't bring myself to sell.
Seriously why is he here
It has been a very stressful one and a half years relatively speaking. I DCA’d as best as I could down to $272.
Average down? He’s going to buy the top again.
YES, that is the key. If you have conviction about a business then you would continue buying at more and more lower levels that the market is making available to you. Ignore the analysts, the commentators with no skin in game and just keep reading about sector, ceo speeches and weigh bear argument to bull arguments.
This is the real question, that many shares homie coulda make a nice weekly bag even if it was wayyyyy otm
Yes, I was a major fool during that time and still am today.
SELL!!!
After Rivian, Ford and Chevy all announced that they were going to be switching to Teslas plugs and use their charging network. All while they continue to increase their production capacity and continue to surpass delivery expectations?..  Are you mad or just regarded?
They definitely don't. Otherwise, they couldn't have record quarters so many times. It's just that it's cool to hate on Tesla. Huge success comes with its fair share of haters :)
I hear you 100%.  I’m just not big brained enough yet for that stuff. Alluding to the top comment - I currently only have the patience to buy a position, hold, and do nothing.  I applaud those who understand options trading. I’m just not there yet.
Not sure why this gets downvoted when it is exactly right.
And have the shares called away?
Probably not lol. What would you do?
150k/year on 190k of TSLA stock, seems totally legit/safe. At 10-20$ otm weeklies, he would have gotten called away so many times, or had to buy himself out at a loss.
Bro why you gambling with your 401K?
Lol talk is cheap.
Yeah cause he would have known that it was going to keep dropping. It's easy to look back and give advice
I meant to put my buy average in title. Yes, I bought near ATHs unfortunately and watched the account drain. It’s a miracle I managed to DCA  below $300.
I'll trade getting the $1,000 if you instead give it to someone struggling on the streets!
Who cares if you lose the house waiting amirite
You guys go bankrupt just by holding stocks?  Warren Buffet would like to have a word.
Opportunity costttttt….
Depends which ev company you invest in.  Mullens is down 99.66% in last year.
Omg so True , the problem is to wait many years and have money in order to invest and let it hold , which a lot of us don’t have these days
Sir, you are apparently not a degenerates like rest of this sub. I'm not sure I should congratulate you or shame you for not being one.
In this long term journey, maybe the real return was the bags we held along the way.
112 shares. +$15,977 here  First share purchased day before cyber truck reveal
Genuine question what is your acceptable price to sell out at? 🤔 I bought in start of January this year and plan on holding for at least five years but have started asking myself where I take a bit back 🤔
Lol tf sell
You didn’t bag hold. This is just called regular ass investing. Good job On not being regarded
You have to pyramid your bids at higher amounts as it goes down AND on the off chance the market tanks you need regular capital coming in from passive source to keep buying up to 50% below your first lot. In high interest environment, borrowing on margin would eat your gains but works in bull markets.  This way you are leveraged with high number of shares without cost of debt and a rally back to modest levels already places you back to break even much earlier giving you more options (no not those options lol) to sell lower priced lots for gains and buy other names that haven’t caught up yet.
Sell any covered calls along the way to lower your cost basis?
Exactly, and use the profits to DCA down to get even greater return once the TSLA came back up     But maybe he is one of those from r/investing that just buy and hold shit for eternity, warren buffet style
Is it "the wheel" you are referring to kind sir?
How exactly would you do this? Please explain to fellow new degenerates
you’re looking at a micro perspective, i’m looking at the macro.
May the force be with you, and hopefully you’ll never get to option trading.
Selling options is the way, in my opinion.  But I only sell what I'm willing to buy or sell.
Probably less of a headache overall and TSLA is definitely one of those stocks that can go banana both ways. The chance to get called away is always there with a CC on it.
You think the degenerates here actually understand options trading? Hahahaha
Being big brained is dangerous
It's WSB, lol
You don't have to wait until the expiration date on the covered calls. You can buy back the contracts earlier and keep the difference between what you got upfront for the contract and what you bought it back for. Or you can roll the calls further out and not let them get assigned.
I would sell courses on tiktok
How is that gambling its literally investing?    He literally bought shares in his 401k.  Historically DCAing does worse than buying in all at once.
I don’t say sell or anything with it. It’s 60% mutual funds and 40% stocks, mainly Home Depot, Apple, Microsoft, and I had a good feeling about Tesla, then it exploded, died and is back. I have other roll overs and regular investments too, so it’s not like I was gambling on my future, really Tesla is the only “risky” of them, they’re mainly all long term bets, it’s also my only non dividend one.
I have the account statements to prove I can trade.  But forget about me.  Bagholding TSLA since 280 is nuts, lol. I have no idea how people do it.
Never sell at a loss, wait till the company evaporates and the loss never accrues.
If you have 200k laying around I would sure hope the fuck you have enough to maintain in between holding the bag
MULN's not an EV company, their business model is selling stock to marks lol
    [X] shame          [  ]  congratulate
Good for you now go on an giiit him not you
2 shares origanily. $2200 cost. Now at 30 shares never bought any more. 280+%. $2200 is valued at close to $8,000 now. I’m hoping it will hit a 10 trillion market cap so my $2200 investment will be $50k+ 10 year.
Well if you're a gigabull you'll hold till the market cap hits 10T, or lose half your gains in the process.
When Tesla hits a 10 trillion market cap. Do the math.
Thank you.
I do irregular ass investing
75% of my portfolio was deposited last year.  I bought the fucking dip.  I'm already past break even and profiting.
Yea but look at the cost basis 😒  idk how these idiots get all this money and don't know how to manage it properly, Warren B would not condone this type of "investing"
How does this work and we're can I learn this power?
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)
What does your penis size have to do with this? /s
Would love to hear your perspective..
If you buy shares, it goes red, you wait, it has a chance to come back up. If you bought options, and it goes red, and you wait, it’ll go to 0 and will not come back
That is the way.
Yeah, people saying to write OTM calls, how far OTM would he have had to write them? Look at the price history +10-25$ in a week wasn't even that unusual.
The success of rolling depends on how far the call moved against the seller.
ok then prove to me u can trade and tell me where should be the top for tsla to sell & buy back in
Bagholding a solid company stock is how many people are up more t han 1000% on their accounts.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|27189)
Well yea, if you have $200k invested, I sure hope you have $200k  (and not on margin)
Gotta love the 25 rs to hold $1 just long enough before the selling started again.
Loose half gains? As in via tax? I currently have no idea what Id tap out at but plan on holding for a fair while
That is sexy math 😍😍 I honestly have no idea how high it could go but been looking at the projected figures and some are scary high 🤣 maybe this is my Lucky break
So the real question is what are u going to do next?!
I wish I had an award to give.  I don’t know why but that made me laugh out loud.
Just because certain people are born into wealth or somehow Aquire it, it doesn't make them good investors/traders
Yes but in the OP's case, Tesla dropped way below his cost basis for a long time, so he would have been ok selling CC. However, now that Tesla is above his cost basis it is more risky, so if he wants to keep the shares, I wouldn't do it now
Not only am I not going to prove anything to you, I’m going to block you.
No like it might plummet like it did in 2022
10 trillion is where I see it. But in my life time it could be anything. I mean apple just hit 3 trillion? Don’t you think all these company’s are fighting for that 10 trillion market cap? Who’s the first? Probably Elon. It’s all about the ratio, how fast, Tesla has rapid growth. Compare it to ford and gm, it’s now on its way to surpass not just one, but some of them combined. Tesla will see 10 trillion. Apple will. Google will. The rest? Couldn’t tell u. Get some funds together. Pay off debt. I seen Tesla at $150 a few months ago, I knew it would go back up, now look at my dumb ass, shoulda coulda woulda. I’m still not buying! I just ain’t got it. I’m trying tho. I start with 2, now at 30. Just because of splitting. So that feels good.
Sell and buy at 400.
Wha…whatever the fuck I want?
You are right, he could easily buy back from the market if things didn’t go his direction, and still he would be at a cheaper cost basis than when he purchased it. Basically free premiums missed for 2 years.
Been in TSLA since 2014. It always recovers. If I had been adding money in it over the years, I'd be retired by now...
If it does I will buy your bags at -50% discount! Don’t worry it’ll be in good hands ![img](emote|t5_2th52|31225)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)![img](emote|t5_2th52|27189)
Oh yes 🤣 well there is always that risk too.
I only started in jan. See it as a potential retirement plan to get out early if it goes where people smarter than me think it will
Lmao
.... like are you gonna sell and walk away? Or buy more
Hindsight is 20/20. I've personally done great with covered calls while stocks chop sideways.   Biggest problem I've had is when the stock rallies so hard that I'm more red in the call than green in the stock.  Like TQQQ lol
I'm long on Tesla and it's my main position but I understand there's always risk involved with volatile stocks like this.   Call me unrealistic and delusional but I'll probably keep holding until it hits the thousands.
Only if you sell them back to me at 300% when the stock peaks again
I'm sorry, I was not trying to be mean.  I thought this was a Bam Margera reference. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAHMXPOPpy8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAHMXPOPpy8) watch the very end to understand.  Yah, to answer your question, I am just going to keep holding of course.  If I had extra cash I would definitely be buying still.
Gulp well I guess you hedged some of the risk, else you would have been all in the red haha
I should rephrase my comment and say TSLA has always recovered but past behavior does not guarantee future behavior.  I agree with you in holding. I just don't know what the exit plan for long term TSLA investors is.
I think the same. Most of us holding probably do, the price will only go up!
3000% and we got a deal ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)![img](emote|t5_2th52|27189)
Lol no clue what or who bam margera is. I have 200 shares and holding too and also got some options. It seems like the run is just getting started but who knows could be wrong
Bet
Very nice.    Of course - no one knows what the future holds.  But I agree.  I feel that the market is slowly waking up to a future led by new technologies whose origins can be found in AI, and is forecasting in the short and long term economic growth as a result of AI-driven tech.  The tech sector, along with TSLA, will continue to carry the market imo.  There will be occassional, healthy pullbacks.  The only thing stopping it is Putin going extra insane or a future Black Swan event.    .
I'm no professional, but my understanding is margins may have dropped which could hurt the stock.  Unless Tesla's production costs dropped and that's what allowed Tesla to lower prices.  We will see come earnings.  I'm not sure if I'd want to hold leverage through earnings.  Just my opinion.
If you knew Jackass then you also knew Bam :D
Eh just 200 shares. You bought nearly 800 and stayed firm through the ups and downs. I bought and sold through the 2020 astronomical rise but didn’t have the guts to hold then. I agree, I think we are in a new revolution just as once upon a time we were in with the agricultural and industrial revolutions but this one will be driven by AI and this one will be far larger given the computing power that will augment human intelligence and take us to new places and ideas we have never seen or even thought possible. Teslas and Nvidias and Microsofts will be leading the charge.
you mean the nuclear bombing
Even if that is true (probably not bc the costs probably dropped), there is just so much going on at Tesla that i think the bigger risk is not holding Tesla shares.
The future truly is now.
100% agreed, I'm just holding shares.  I loaded the boat under $140.
This isn’t true. Both Germany and Netherlands also had another inflation increase.
Inflation rate: 17.76%
The opportunity to reverse colonize is here.
Also us core inflation rose regards
And they all had to work today
Imagine being so stupid you can't even pretend the numbers are good like everybody else.  Europoors don't want to be one of the cool kids, huh?
God is finally striking down the people who deserve it
TIL that colonists somehow aren’t also colonizers.   Happy Tax-Evasion Day you ignorant regard 😘
Uk is fucked and probably will be forever but the EU has a slight problem. Spain and a few others have dialled inflation in, Germany and the Netherlands etc haven't. So the ECB have to fiddle with economies sharing the same currency, but experiencing different issues.   The giant issue with the Eurozone.
We can take the ‘great’ out of Britain now.. it’s a fuked up country!
Euro poor ain’t just a meme
Highest inflation amongst the G7 countries. Yeah Brexit, weak pound, economy still recovering from Covid, British businesses still paying back their version of the PPP loans, and couple dozen more issues. Not a great time to be a Brit Bong right now.
Brits are still fucked by BREXIT  I was in London a month ago and every Brit was annoyed at the Eurostar station @ King's Cross. They used to be able to quickly clear the security using the EU line. But after BREXIT, they had to wait in a long line like rest of us Americans. It was hilarious because every Brit was bitching about good old days when UK was part of EU
Who believes government numbers?
The Royal Family printing all that 💵 for themselves
So they arent lying as much as the US cause our figures been bs the whole time
That’s why in god we trust. He gave us the best geographical location in the world thousands of miles away from any country with potential threats. We are bordered with two friendly countries. We are energy independent unlike Eurozone. We have the most vibrant economy in the west.
Can’t play cricket, can’t play monopoly
We're royally fucked
EU will get harvested. We did it again. Yay
Happy Fourth of Regards!!!
This isn’t true because Britain‘s economy is not big enough to be major

If you really dialed it in, you would bare the same thing in the states.   Inflation is rarely uniform across a large region
You mean, the same problem as the United States too? Oh no, whatever will they do?!?
The taste of their food and the beauty of their women, made the British the best sailors in the history of the world
I'd wager that the vast majority of those in those security/immigration check lines were ones who voted to remain.
Those are the same people who wanted the UK to have the Euro so... It'd save them from having to convert their money when they went on holiday.
You don't have to believe anything, they litterary tell you how they calculate the it (ask someone with normal IQ to help explain it for you).    What can you offer to discredit them? Your "feelings" that the numbers are false because some OnlyFans guy is charging you $10 extra for feet pics this month? Get out...
Europeans believe absolutely everything their government tells them.
Homeschooled I take it? ![img](emote|t5_2th52|8883)
well, maybe tell God to chill out with the fires in Canada and the floods, somehow followed by droughts in California.....  Also, couldn't God find us a better southern neighbor? maybe uruguay instead.
It is, but not for long…
Do those countries even have electricity yet?
Dunno.   I live in Spain. Our inflation is back to normal. 🤷‍♂️
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
How do we know your IQ is normal? I rather suspect it’s below average.
Yeah exactly, did you pay rent this month or did you pay owner's equivalent rent? Is your phone better than last year? In that case the price didn't actually go up. Did you eat Walmart ground beef instead steak? That's basically the same meat. No inflation bruh. Everything's fine.
No u. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|27421)
That's why he said ask someone with a normal IQ. Because he can't explain it.
True, he failed to distinguish that the thought, “Who believes government numbers?” is by definition not a feeling.   I would trust the opinion of someone who can’t distinguish thoughts from feelings. Their views must be inexorable.

The stock market is going up because all disposable wealth around the world has no better option to beat inflation. It's actually very simple. We're looking at currency devaluing at 5% or more every year out of our wealthiest countries. The US stock market is the biggest and safest means to try preserving money.
Best 1st half of the year for QQQ in history and these are the posts we get. Time to short everything.

This guy bulls
Apple, making less money and less per share with headwinds on product lines… all time highs. Nvidia, can’t move inventory for shit and is making less money than last year… all-time highs. The Magnificent 7 tech stocks are carrying this market, along with 0-1DTE call buying and put selling. It’s a time bomb.  All this shit got crazy when market makers opened up daily options on indexes and index ETFs…
Brace for impact boys, iceberg ahead. You just sunk the market.

There was no need to clarify that you aren't a financial advisor, that much at least is completely obvious.
Heard an idiot at work say to buy ai stock because it’s going to be big… time to sell everything.
Markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent. John Maynard Keynes  Supreme Court shot down loan forgiveness and loans become due again in a few months. The shockwave from this will at the least cause more sideways action, but will likely cause another downturn. There's no way you can convince me a country of debt was smart enough to plan for those loans to be due again after the last 3 years of spending.
Strongest democracy lol. It’s incredibly weak
How in the world did you get the Idea that the USA is the „best democracy in the history of the world“ because that is definitely a lie

Just buy NVDA and chant AI.
I like how part of the post says “USA will continue to lead energy development both in the tradition [sic] and clean areas.”… and I’m like, clean areas? Sweet heart, there are parts of Europe that run on ONLY renewable resources lol
CPI inflation peaked in June 2022. All CPIs we've seen since have been against rising inflation of one year prior, making inflation reduction look good. The the next report in July which will be June numbers will be as good as it gets.  After this you will be comparing CPI to year ago inflation numbers that will be dropping, making good comps harder to achieve.  Core is still high and going nowhere with strong market and employment. Core will not come down without more rate hikes.
>when they pivot, bull market!   Puts it is
You aren't a financial advisor?! Damn, I was convinced after that stellar analysis.
Why don't you mention 10y3 month inversion, or recessionary leading indicators like Manufacturing, New Orders, Industrial Production? Why don't you mention the near term forward spread? Your analysis takes place in a vacuum.
The average gain for a bull market is **112%** so if this one is typical we have a very long way to go. This one's a baby - just passed through the 20% mark.
US Home Builders are going full tilt.  New home creation is the catalyst for retailers and industrials.  In the first year of home ownership, the owners will spend as much money decorating, furnishing etc, than they will spend in the following 3 years.  This is BULLISH.       Inflation is below 5% & dropping.  This is BULLISH.  Oil is cheap.  This is BULLISH.  S&P EPS is tracking @ $220, next year approx $246.  (S&P Dow Jones estimate at June 30'23)  This is BULLISH.  Mkt bottomed October 13th.  Nasdaq +37%, S&P500 +24.4%.  (A bull market is defined as >20% move from the bear market low.) Though it could be a bear trap, the more time put between Oct 13th & the present is good.   This is BULLISH.  There is an historic amount of cash sitting in money market etc.  This is BULLISH.  Consumer confidence was up in June.  This is BULLISH.  Interest rate increases are almost done.  This is BULLISH.  Corporate balance sheets are in good shape, overall.  They are not weighed down by debt.  This is BULLISH.   \*\*\*I am a financial advisor, and personally I am all-in.  This is my opinion based on extensive research and discussion with money managers, strategists and institutional traders.   (Also the 5th bear market I've experienced professionally.)
Never bet against America!

No.
aYup
Gorilla or bear in the room is the interest rate of 5.25% and the growing number of businesses and households that cannot roll over debt at that rate. I am neutral.
I'm not sure the earnings reports will be very good this time around.
Next year going to be wild bear market is over

Guess I'm buying more GRND, subscriptions are going to explode when the economy recovers.
Is there publicly accessible data on global liquidity? I feel like the story of 2023 is cash from outside the US needing somewhere to go. Would like to a better way to watch this trend going forward.
I believe in capitalism and the American market but pls don’t kid yourself about US politics they’re a joke.
Inflation is not down. They just keep changing the way they calculate it to make it seem that way. Inverse op to make money
All you mentioned is priced in. Not a surprise. Wheres the next upside catalyst coming from?  Absent a new driver prices will stagnate.
>Clean energy…will decouple the world from OPEC  Maybe, in around 20 years. The stock market looks out about 18 months.  China has a big lead in green energy, btw.  https://fairbank.fas.harvard.edu/research/blog/how-china-is-winning-the-race-for-clean-energy-technology%EF%BF%BC/
I think this guy missed the headlines where the fed is hawkish about everything. 🤭
Damn, I hate seeing posts like this. Means the top is in
This would piss off the maximum number of people so it’s probably the most likely outcome.
I agree with most of this, but the real tell will happen at the end of the year when student loan repayments start back. How many people will be defaulting on that, or simply refuse to pay? Gonna be an interesting winter, that’s for sure.
SP500 new ATH soon! Nvidia to 700! Tesla to 10 trillions! Let's Go!
Why can't we just have a good old fashioned pullback to the mean and then a continuation higher? All you hear is the market's either going to crash or it's going to the moon from here. At this point a mean reversion is going to seem like a crash but that's not the case.
Your lips to God's ears, as my Grandmother used to say....
Wtf are you talking about? Core cpi inflation (what the fed looks at) has barely moved. It’s gone from 6.5% to 6%. They are going to raise and hold rates until 2025.   https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CORESTICKM159SFRBATL
PEs of 200 for everyone!
You ain't seen nothing yet.  You better talk to Cathie Woods.
The issues are going to becone apparent outside of America first. Japan Italy Australia Canada all great contenders for contagion
I agree it's going up, but not the reasons you outlined. 0DTE + unlimited liquidity and free money. It's all a simulation for the market to up. It can't be stopped.
Cherish recent good time, bro. Storm is right on its way
Dude the sec paused. Once they restart it will fake out.
Yeah everything is awesome!  A massive increase in food stamp use, not enough affordable housing, record amount of theft causing large retailers to close down show how great things are going
When WSB is drooling all around for a crash, it's time to get in  When WSB is jacking off to bullish wins, it's time to get out  Puts it is then
clean energy isn't so much working lately.   could be a bubble
LOL, no.  1. When rate hikes stop, money from stonks flow to bonds (check current ERP) 2. Oil reserves depleted, don't have the largest ones either 3. That's a race with Asia and they know their shit. It's too late, they already have the know-how. They traded that for cheap manufacturing 4. That happens before a recession 5. A bipartisan system that had armed riots in the la last presidential election and has people like ron de santis or greg abbott as governors  Thank god that's your opinion and not financial advice.
Top is in thanks for the confirmation
Technically the Fed still has to unwind trillions and trillions of dollars in positions they took with all the QE. If they keep that on perma pause or do it at such a slow rate it would take decades or centuries, we're probably still good for going to the moon and whatnot.
Looks like we’re in for a recession
Hahaha on #5

Americans are traveling en masse this summer despite record high prices and crowds.   Tomato girl summer is blowing up 🚀  Padam 🌛🌜  It’s money season
You should go all in, Biden says the US financial markets are great.
I agree. The only thing that can take the market down is some sort of financial crises and I don’t see it. For those of us who lived through 2008 there is nothing sick/wrong with the financial plumbing like back then.
Yeah you forgot to mention all the banks that are going to fail in late 2023 early 2024
McDoubles still are 120% higher. U won’t be able to eat fast food once ur cleaned
We’re not a democracy, that’s the only point I care about
Go outside and buy literally anything then confidently tell me inflation is going down lol
I let my Cat pick my strike prices now.. his name is Warren.. hes not bad.. better than me.. but he has been buying alot of puts recently so I hope you are wrong.
Everything you said was the same under the previous administration but none of it happened yet and it won’t happen in the next few quarters. APUs by 2025 for example is my guess
Idiots were saying during last bull run that the bull market lasts 8 years on average and suddenly they forgot it, we've just started the bull run, first the tech stocks dumped last year and theyre rising first, next value stocks will go up. Investing is the easiest game in town when you pay attention.
Cry how much you want but there is no bull mkt anytime near. Even if you touch ATH or SPX $5000 you will go -50% to $2500. So the better thing would be to go $3200 from here instead of choosing the insanity path.
I had to laugh at point 5!! What the fuck? Are you being sarcastic or are you completely delusional?  Best and strongest democracy? Really? DEMOCRACY??? Maybe you should look up the word.  America hasn’t been a functioning democracy for quite a while…a parody of one.
1. Yes 2. False, any surplus goes back into filling up the SPR. 3. Possibility but all traditional metrics are grossly overstretched. 4. Speculation, the service sector is the one area that has not reached full capacity. Most other sectors are on hiring freezes or are actively laying people off. The job market is complete cheeks right now. 5. False, you gotta get out more.
I disagree simply on point #2. Where are you seeing the production of energy keeping up with demand with oil rigs dropping, natural gas being made at a loss, and solar + wind being nowhere near reliable enough to run the entire country off of it. Also the US is having the most blackouts right now during peak summer demand. Not to mention OPEC + might just straight embargo us now that the SCO and BRICS nations accepted the Iranian Mercantile Exchange as their new official commodities market. I see this all affective the “bull” market as countries de-dollarize.
Beside point 2 and 3 it is wild guessing, and non-fact based  bs
LOL 2-5 is a joke. I love how OP uses everything in future tense. This is like one of those mantras you write on the wall: if you speak it, it’ll come true. I WILL have a bigger penis next year 🤣 it ain’t gonna happen bud.
Tell me you’ve never studied history without telling me you’ve never studied history.
Not too sure we can keep this trend going, and my reasoning is simple:  All credit accounts have limits, and those limits have or are about to be maxed. These poor souls that borrowed everything they got will not be able to sustain payments on all the extremely high debt they racked up over the last 3 years, and will most likely default their way back into a low-tier life once again, and the money you have been seeing being pumped into the market by off-the-streeter's will dry up once and for all.
Bearish
Where do you live that you see inflation dropping 1% per month? That's just total bullshit. Don't know what reports you read.

Time to go short i guess
Doesn’t history show that once the Fed pivots, there is a nice rally followed by an intense sell off?
You forgot to mention AI. Thus, your conclusions are flawed. Besides, Putin nukes Ukraine, China invades Taiwan.
I have my doubts.  Inflation is stubborn. If it somehow goes down (meaning reaching the Fed target, or close by at least) by the end of the year, maybe. Since expendable income is decreasing constantly, I ask myself who will buy these optional services.  Global population growth is reaching a peak. That means less demand. Or at least, it should.    [Future Population Growth - Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/future-population-growth)
The best and strongest democracy? LOL
Got it. The party is over and it is time to sell.
Thanks you made me LOL
Absolutely, but don't forget the rug pull.
Can’t wait for the second wave of inflation
Look up how inflation is calculated, then look up last years monthly numbers and you’ll see inflation is going up next release. OP in for some losses
Feds aren’t done with rate hikes yet my good sir
It’s Obvious you read all the reports that came out last week.
Can the market go down more in the 2nd half than it rose in the 1st half of the year? The answer is Yes.
hopium

Bear market starting confirmed. See you at 3600
Inverse that shit. Time to buy puts lol 😂
Can't wait for a financial advisor to give financial advice 😞
Sell your calls, buy your puts, WE'RE GOING DOWN.
Wouldn't all these companies need banger results every quarter for a year to justify these prices?.........yeah maybe it just keeps going up because walstreet cocaine

This September will be one to remember. All the traders will return from vacation and tank the market
Damn I was looking forward to the bull market
Your analysis failed from your first reason. Fed rate hike cycle is not near finished. They have paused it for now but will probably continue for the next couple years.  Also point 2, Biden will start to snuff that out to buy votes from the pansy vegans. Point 3, has no relevance. Point 4 is fake news. And point 5 is the most false claim I’ve seen on the internet.
1. That’s due to deflation which happens and then there is another spike up. This is as people are running out of money and utilizing credit cards at an absurd rate. Prime credit card rates are nearly 18%. People will not be able to drive to work as they are getting repossessed, they will get fired, and then evicted. Fed wants to see 4 million people unemployed and we are at half that.  2. Energy production is high but exports are high too.  3. Sounds like the Metaverse…  4. There will be revisions just like the GFC…  5. Right…
Student Loan Bubble
The bull market started in 2009.   We still haven’t seen the bear.  This is all a massive topping process that could take us to new highs before dropping the hammer.  Where will all the $ come from to power the markets going forward?  QE?  No.  Retiring Boomers? No.  Broke Millennials? No.
Even though Biden isn’t popular there’s no denying that his boring leadership is bringing calm and focus to his admin. Mending economic ties that trump anihilated in his “trump first” administration.

It's not here yet. But I feel like it's still 18 months out. Hikes will end when inflation rates come down, but inflation falling means people are getting cautious with money.
Threee rate hikes 150 basis points come next March %10 -20 percent from October 2022
Was waiting to see this. Doubling down my short.
Can you spoonfed me on what to buy? You know im poor so I need big gains. Can't lay back on my money enjoying the little but steady n safe gains.
Civics course first.
Bulls have existed for centuries, and have long been an important agricultural and cultural endeavors like the running of the bulls. The market for bulls has not just started, it’s been around for a long time, and will be here for a long time to come. Maybe one day AI will replace bulls with VR bulls, but until then…
It’s when the Fed cuts rates that you should start worrying, historically.
Thanks OP ya jinxed it, it'll start to end come July 5th
Biggest argument why there WILL be a recession is because this sub says there won’t be
Yeah no, there are systemic problems in the banking/inflation/interest rate environment that will kill more banks before everything is said and done. And chances are that Republicans in the house won’t have the backbone to stand up to next year’s spending binge, compounding the issue.
So you’ve returned.
So basically OP is selling calls and he's trying to lube us up.
Forget about the College debt repayment starting, mass layoffs in tech, an upcoming election, mass debt, and the bursting of commercial real estate…
Yaaasss please be my bag holder. I'm starting to dca out on good days.
Geeze. Sell I suppose, was hoping for more upside but now I don't know
Well, we all know rate hikes take at least a 6 month lag to ripple through the economic system. The economy is in an the balance but everything is pointing towards an economic slide
Reminds me of all the posts this January outlining why TSLA would continue to fall below 100 ![img](emote|t5_2th52|31249)

In other words: Murica.
Let’s see-   1.) inflation is still twice what is considered healthy/sustainable and it doesn’t show any sign of letting up without continued tightening from the Fed.  2.) Household savings have dropped by the largest measure in decades. Household debut has skyrocketed.      3.) Layoffs are continuing to increase while open positions are being cancelled.      4.) Dumb money in flocking into the market at a record pace.      It’s time to buy value stocks that have been undervalued.
The future is unwriiten

when theres a DD on WSB ensuring stocks will keep going up after going up for 8 months striaght makes me positive the market will tank.   this is all i needed.

This is the correct answer.   And everyone wants to kick the can down the road instead of letting a recession do it's job.

Meanwhile, how long can a 28oz Gatorade at $1.79 be sustainable? How long can we go until $14.99 per lb of deli turkey is no longer affordable? The economy needs deflation. We need a recession. The unfortunate part is thag instead of letting a recession gut all the inefficiency in the marketplace government will just print money and kick the can down the road.
So rates go up is bad for market rates go down also bad for market? GTFO
The last 3 years disagree with this regarded take.  And the fact its so upvoted proves the top is far from in.
The most recent two rate cuts have been extremely bullish. The 2019 rate cuts triggered a massive rally into covid, and of course the covid rate cuts did as well.  The early 2000s rate cut following the dotcom bubble also resulted in a large stock market rally.
Everyone else printed a shitload of money.
Thoughts on a long call for DPST to recover? Maybe a 70$ strike for 2024/2025?
It’s the one of the few times in history where the undisputed leading country by military just decided to not invade everywhere.   For almost all of human history the leader in military just went on a feeding frenzy with smaller nations. This brought about the Pax Americana, which lead to massive prosperity across the globe and relative peace for most of the world. We have literally been in one of the longest golden ages of human history. Nearly every single thing has gotten better over the last 100 years.  I don’t know if people outside the US understand this, but literally everyone in the US just thinks (and they’re probably right) that we can easily conquer any nation. We, through US culture, just decide not to even though colonization would probably help the average US citizen.  Do you understand how insane that is? Or, put differently, do you understand how historically against the norm that is?
Sounds like an angry limey……lol
I also don’t get it. Looking on trump and the dem vs gop I wonder if this democracy will be stable in the next years

This is making too much sense.   We need VisualMod’s words of wisdom. Wya? Michael Burry is still alive and well in the market.
Just 23 trillion printed since then.  Financial plumbing is squeaky clean!
There were 3 bounces of 20%+ off lows during the 2000-2002 bear market and 2 bounces of 20%+ during the 2008-2009 bear market. The talking heads claiming that 20% bounce off a low means it’s a new bull market are flat out wrong. There have been many times where that has not been the case.

Niether side will slow spending. We are on a collision course with hyperinflation in the near future because we don't have leadership anymore just thieves and conartists.
My grandma asked me how to open a Robinhood account. It's time to sell.
But every top comment under a bull thread shares your thought.  So which side do we invert?
Right. Never mind the dozens of posts calling for an imminent tank 😂. Somehow everyone will be wrong.
This time its going to be differently the same
The previous bull market lasted for almost 2 years, you are clueless. I'm making bank inversing people like you
and the fact that i just bought aapl calls

For real, thos whole rally was nonstop bear posting about why NVDA was topping and AI was a bubble  Now every 1 is full blown bull
Spy is around the same price it was March 2022.  I Don't really see straight up, more of a year plus dip and recovery or sideways motion.
F\*\*\*, now I don't know what to do, do I inverse Jim Cramer or WSB... Two worthy sources of inversion.
My portfolio is made up completely of OTM Ford calls, I found a recent video of Jim Cramer explaining why Ford is such a good deal. He didn’t even know the difference between a Mustang and a Mach-E.
Is there an inverse Cramer ETF?

>Right. Never mind the dozens of posts calling for an imminent tank 😂. Somehow everyone will be wrong.  Wait for Jim to tweet that we are skipping the pullback
People have been calling for a pullback for months. The "pullbacks" is the random $5 QQQ red day, and then you buy the dip with everything you got, since it can't possibly do down.
Which won't have nearly the impact you think.
Dollar will be done if any other country that has atleast more than 16 air craft carrier.  Even if saudi stops accepting dollars it wont stop anything .
Yup
Guys since you all disliked what I said I want to clear out what I actually meant. Our nation had always been an ideal democracy but now we are slowly becoming plutocratic. Being a true American, we all must not ignore this fact. We want the democracy and equity to thrive in this country for generations to come. For that, we must raise voice to the ones who are in charge when they take plutocratic decisions. We have been falling constantly in the democracy index and it disheartens me. If we all do not even acknowledge that a problem exists, then how can we solve it. We mustn’t be ignorant of what is going on. I read a really concerning ranking which I have attached below.  https://preview.redd.it/ommlz1ahhx9b1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b0c098d247356890093056079ae20d351e4a9b50  This is not my fallacy but a well studied fact that democracy is gradually losing ground. But it still is one of the most powerful democracies in the world. And we the people need always to take necessary measures to protect this great status. That was all I meant.
We aren't a democracy you twat.
Mind you language sir
From their financial statements? Inventory did drop in the last release, but before then it'd increased from \~$1b to \~$5b. Largely because their gaming sales have collapsed, but AI sales are doing well.
Not that long ago like a year
Just make more money. Things always go up, this isn’t new. $1 today is not $1 30 years ago nor $1 in 30 years.
Yes actually, in the long run there is no good outcome when rates are this high. Rate cuts signal that the fed has done what it needs to do to inflict substantial economic pain to return inflation to its normal range. Things will recover but only after a period of hardship.
The cause and effect is backwards here. The reality is that rates won't be cut until the market is already crashing.   Anyone thinking the Fed is going to cut rates and let prices go even higher than now is just an idiot. The Fed is watching prices, and wants them to come down. The only way you get to experience the post-cut takeoff of asset prices is if prices already crashed first.
> resulted in  Yes, but what were the conditions like at the time of the rate cut? You think they cut rates because we were at the start of a new bull run as OP thinks? Or at the time they started cutting were things looking a bit shit for the next few quarters?
And it doesn't matter. What matters is whether that money is liquid and being used to scoop up starter homes or not.
I am regard, I have no thoughts. I only do.  &#x200B;  Let's say 2025 is possible and let's hope 500$.
Where the hell do you learn your history/real life events?
Where did you get your historical education?  The US fought many wars in the past 100 years.  They couldn't even conquer and control Vietnam or Afghanistan. Colonization LMAO  Nothing of this has to do with the stability of the US democracy anyway.  Better nobody tells him about greenbay sweep and Jan6.
None of that makes it the “best democracy in the history of the world”. It goes to show that instead of using measures of how your average citizen actually benefits from democracy, like quality of life or standard of living, you instead use military and economic power.  Having said that, military and economic power are great catalysts for stock returns so I don’t disagree with the overall sentiment.
I never thought about it like that, fascinating angle.
And No, the US wouldnt be able to „colonize“ earth
The US is the most powerfull Nation in the History of Earth (maybe not relatively seen) but that dosnt make it a great democracie, Americans always seem to do that, no matter what the Diskussion is about they will always bring up how they could invade this or that country. But that shit dosnt matter
Aside from the economics this is a very interesting point lol. I suppose the world is now more connected than ever before so this makes Traditional Imperialism quite hard.
Just take a look at the world Freedom Index buddy, and no im not a „limey“
Got any stats or charts to back that up?

Isn’t the Mach-E a Mustang? I remember all the car nerds getting outraged when it was announced, calling it an insult to mustangs.
Coupled with recent rate hikes that take years to show their true damage, it may impact it more than you think.
If the EU was truly a federation. Then organized all  all the militaries. Then stopped playing with capital controls then yea the dollar would have an alternative.   But all this talk about BRICS replacing the dollar is dumb. South Africa has black outs Russia is Russia. People say BRICS so they don’t have to admit how fking stupid it is that the South African Rand will be part of replacing the dollar…
Uhh a constitutional republic is still a form of democracy you twat.   We have a representative democracy. Just because it’s not a direct democracy doesn’t make it any less of a democracy.
Did you miss their guidance where they project the best quarter ever?

Things will recover means good for market no? Lol or u will select some arbitrary timeline and claim that market will always crash?
They cut rates because inflation went down, inflation is currently going down.
Not from Reddit

Read up on history. The last 100 years have seen one of the lowest per capita rates ever for military involvement.  The US conquered Afghanistan in 72 hours. We had more friendly fire fatalities than enemy fire fatalities.  The problem was that Americans are criminally undereducated with the war. Here’s the thing, if the US actually went to war for oil, we would have taken their oil in 72 hours and made them a US colony. And there’s not anything anyone could do about it. If conquering was goal, we could have. But that wasn’t the goal and it’s embarrassing you don’t know that
I don’t necessarily disagree but it’s also an impossible measurement.  How would you want to quantify it? Specifically?  Name the metrics, use another country as the example, then explain how that country would still have that characteristic without the presence for the US.   Yeah, Scandinavia is great, luckily Putin doesn’t control it. France is nice, good thing someone destroyed Nazi Germany. Yeah, Germany is nice, good thing it didn’t remain a colony of Russia. New Zealand is beautiful, good thing it’s not under Japanese occupation. The “benefits of the average citizen” in nearly every single democracy on Earth is with the condition that they are sovereign, something the US has strongly enforced since the Pax America. I mean, what situation do you think Ukraine would be in right now if it weren’t for US support? It’s gotten to point where that’s basically the only thing that actually matters. If Germany cut support to Ukraine, you would read about in a CNN article one day and it largely wouldn’t matter. If the US cut support, that’s basically it, the war is kind of over at that point.   I’m actually curious if you can name an example. I can’t think of one.
That’s literally the most important thing. France holding protests about the retirement age increase can only happen because things are so good. How many retirement protests were going on when Nazi Germany invaded them?

I mentioned 2000-2002 bear market as well. Seems you've ignored that one. Also, you're looking at an average and nothing guarantees anything close to average. The average can be highly skewed by a few long bull runs like the one we had in the 2010s. The median bull run is closer to 4.7 years.  [https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/14/a-look-at-bear-and-bull-markets-through-history.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/14/a-look-at-bear-and-bull-markets-through-history.html)  We've had bull markets of 2.1 years, 2.6 years, 2.6 years, 3.6 years, 4.1 years, 4.1 years, 5 years and 5 years. \*EDIT: my bad brain fart the last bull run was 2.5 years not 3.3 years

Some people think it will have some drastic impact on consumer spending. I really don't think it's that big of a percentage. Only a small portion of the country will be affected. I'm sure a portion of people have been paying their student loans the whole time.
EU not that great. Where are big tech companies ? Except SAP. There are few large auto compaines which and seriously in debt . Its population is aged and they are replacing with immigrats which will cause culture clash . Future of EU does not looks any promising anymore
Brics can work only iff they are using gold . Otherwise it is just bs
It actually does.  There is a reason we aren't a democracy; no mob rule.
Earnings, revenue and inventory are three different metrics. We were not discussing earnings.
Inflation is good for you, now get back to work peasant.  Your 50 cent raise is why housing is unaffordable.
As someone who has gone from making 28k when I started to well over 250k, yes it is me.
lol there's a delayed effect. The rate rises didn't cause a top immediately, and rate cuts will not cause a bottom immediately.

God bless America 🫡
The fact that so many nations are so reliant on the US for their existence/security is not the argument in favor of their sovereignty that you think it is.
It's an impossible measurement if you choose to ignore the very possible measurements that don't rank the US at the top where you might like it to be.   Here's an example ranking: https://www.eiu.com/n/campaigns/democracy-index-2020/  This is how they rank democracies: The Democracy Index is based on five categories: electoral process and pluralism, civil liberties, the functioning of government, political participation, and political culture. Based on their scores on 60 indicators within these categories, each country is then itself classified as one of four types of regime: full democracy, flawed democracy, hybrid regime or authoritarian regime.
Just for the fun exercise - Singapore. Don’t think you can say US supported / protected them, although you may argue that US acts as a safety from China, but that isn’t as direct as your other examples.   Also, Canada -though you may claim NATO helps them out but also not really the same as your other examples.
wich dosn’t make it any less true
Your flair is a victory for Satan
>We are currently at 3.3 years  ???????? wut? the bottom was in half of 2022 and the bull market started last month       >**June 8, 2023, at 4:26 p.m.** The S&P 500 is now in what Wall Street refers to as a bull market   Ok so you have the data but then you fool yourself that we're already at the end of the bull market? you're setting yourself up to lose money.
How he has a show still is beyond questionable
Yeah, EU being an alternative to USA could work if there was zero division, common goals, a fostering business environment. It won't happen neither in EU, nor is it rosy in US, but they've got historical momentum.
Yea the chance for the Euro to replace the dollar was 2007 lol. I think the capital controls if 2008 did them in. The massive anti immigration backlash have not helped. The EU can still theoretically fix it but it is a long shoot.
Ah I see, spoken like a true regard 🫡
Having been to war myself you can't really conquer and control such massive land masses it's impossible.  Put it like this you can't logistically fight an enemy who uses the mountains as a hiding place for hit and run tactics.  Let's say if we went to Ukraine and fought the Russians...it would be a very different outcome because you're fighting a army that wears an uniform.    Fighting an insurgency that infiltrates Afghan army training centers, pays locals to attack soldiers, and gets more recruits from Pakistan is something any army would have a problem fighting against.
No, but it means those countries have an active interest in keeping the status quo. Which means stocks go up and to the right
Lol sorry I had a brain fart. I meant to say the last bull run was from March 2020 to September 2022. So a 2.5 year bull run. And I meant to say to my original point that we aren't necessarily out of the current bear market if your measure is a 20% bounce off a local low because we've seen that MANY times in the past and it hasn't been confirmation of a new bull market. 3 times from 2000-2002 and 2 times from 2008-2009.  This current market reminds me more of 2000 when we had a 2.5 year bear market. The initial sell off was because everything was way over bought and irrational exuberance and speculation caused everything to be overvalued. The market dropped \~25% from mid 2000 to early 2001. A recession didn't kick in until Q2 2001 and then the market dropped another \~30% from there.  Along the way there were bounces of 20%+ three times. So you would have been rejoicing about a new bull market 3 times during that bear market.  The Fed money printing during the pandemic made all sorts of unprofitable and speculative tech stocks sky rocket and so in my opinion the current sell off is just a reversion to the mean and burning off that exuberance. Doesn't account for an economic slow down at all. When you look at forward PE valuations on S&P500 they are higher than at any point during the epic 2010s bull run. That should tell you something about how overvalued stocks have become.  And my original point stands. That using an average length of bull market tells you nothing. The median is far more meaningful and understanding the range of historical bull runs shows you there were many short bull runs.
Chinas demographic issues are like Theta decay lol. Every year China is not number 1 the harder it is to get there.   Also, no one wants to be in a currency union with China. Their currency controls are nuts. Macau and Hong Kong still have separate currencies. If Chinese currency was so superior to the dollar for international exchange don’t you think 2 Chinese cities that have been part of China for 20+ years would use it.  Macau is a particularly damming example its a city of like 500k it does not have a stock exchange. Yet they will not use the Chinese Yuan. Tho Shops will take the US dollar and Hong Kong dollar.
Actually you can but it requires collective punishment and mass murder which has been outlawed by the Geneva convention.  Once the conquered fear the conquerer more than the rebels and infiltrators they will conform.  Respect comes later!
I would completely disregard 2000's data because that era was s total outlier and people shouldnt even look at it probably ever, more even the great depression as thats a totally old world, many companies were entering the tech era and werent making any money, today you have tech money printers and yeah the P/E gets overinflated because of stupid algos but were not gonna have any 20-30% crash because of that, its more like a slight correction tops on the tech but other than that I'm pretty sure it's safe to say to chug along with the market and keep buying, the value stocks are yet to pop off and with them we're gonna hit a new S&P ATH.
 Mass murder and collective punishment without rules of war would result in even more insurgency attacks and possible attacks on western countries.   In Afghanistan you just have people who are really deeply involved in how the Taliban works...they may be on your side one day and the next they'll provide information on your base layout etc because the Taliban paid them more.
So you want to ignore both of the last 2 major recessions because they don’t fit your narrative…  Today we have a massive number of unprofitable companies that are incredibly leveraged and have been living on cheap debt with 0% rates. Many of these companies will have to rethink their business in the coming years as borrowing costs are no longer negligible. In the ZIRP and QE era all that mattered was growth because debt was so cheap. Now these companies will have take on new debt with much higher interest rates and that requires a better return on investment to justify. Profitability actually matters now. In all likelihood a lot of companies will struggle to service the new debt and go bankrupt. And those that don’t will have to cut spending and head count. Sure there are massive companies like big tech that are insanely profitable. But 50% of Americans are employed by small businesses. So there is a high likelihood of rising unemployment due to these businesses struggling which will reduce consumer spending and impact revenue and earnings at the big profitable companies. We can’t simply ignore the fact that monetary policy has flipped 180 degrees and financial conditions have drastically changed for consumers and businesses moving forward. Like 6-7T in corporate debt is maturing the next 2 years.
If you look at humanity historically, they did control vast territories with far less technology by being horrifically brutal.     Attila the Hun would send a messsanger, and the territory either surrendered, or they fought. If they fought, every man, woman, and child in the area would be slaughtered. No mercy.     Which is part of how they conquered such huge territory.       Modern militaries do not do this, for a myriad of reasons, but mostly because they are not run by monsters, nor are the do I in any way believe the troops are monsters who would accept orders to slaughter noncombatant women and children explicitly as a show of force, despite the Hollywood trope. It takes a LOT of tribalist brainwashing and social conditioning to make people do that, and modern militaries do not do that.        Different times, for sure, but that was kinda the point of the original post.
Not if they’re all dead!
You can’t conquer a people who do not wish to be conquered. You can only genocide them or leave them alone. I’m glad we did not decide on the former.
US did/supported plenty of mass murrder and collective punishment in Vietnam.
Mass murder and collective punishment definitely worked. Many ancient and medieval empires controlled vast foreign territories through brutal repression alone. Afghanistan itself was conquered and ruled for most of its existence by a succession of foreign invaders such as the Persians, the Greeks, the Arabs, and finally the Mongols.  The "can't be conquered" meme comes from the British who just didn't care enough about it to expend the resources.  If you want a modern example. Nazi Germany that won WW2 would have easily been able to repress and hold all its conquered territories. They were doing fine against partisans in the middle of a total war they were losing!
There’s a lot of money to be made with money laundering. Not sure what the point of OP is.
How is that inconsistent? BlackRock never said they don't want to make a profit with an index of money laundering.
I see no inconsistency
yes OP, how many of your thoughts have been the same for the last 6 years?
Oh they still think that. But if suckers wanna buy then they'll happily still make money off them.
Just because he calls Bitcoin out as being like crack-cocaine, doesn't mean you can't make money off the junkies who buy it.
You're allowed to change your mind!

This is 6 years later .. god forbid you have a change of heart 🥴
Too regarded, do I puts or do I calls? I know I’m losing money anyway
Both can be correct
People launder money with USD not digital currencies that record every transaction.
People need to know that he probably wasn't on the project, Backrock make hundreds to thousands of ETF, he wouldn't know them all... This is most likely a big team with a substantial AUM that have been putting this together for awhile
Oh no an opinion has changed 6 years later. Very cool.
I’m not a fan of bitcoin but I’m not really gonna shit on someone that changes their position on something after 6 years goes by
Yeah, and guess what happened next? Their filing was rejected by the SEC  https://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-says-spot-bitcoin-etf-filings-are-inadequate-390336e8
Mister Fink had to sit down and shut up once his quants showed him how much money their little monopoly could possibly make if they started offering magic internet money up to the masses, now he's a ~~believer~~... well just on board.
His ESG tricks didn't work
where is the inconsistency?
“Oh, did you think I was criticizing it?! Lol.”  - BlackRock CEO
I mean that was 5 years ago. Are opinions not allowed to change? Perhaps he has become more educated on crypto and has changed his mind on the matter.
$COIN going up up
To be fair, a lot can happen here in five years. Shit, two years ago people said Wish was going to be bigger than Amazon.
Just like Jordan Belfort says it's a scam then he saw how good the scam was then he started shillling nfts
Op wouldn't understand a business opportunity if it smacked him in the face and gave him a $100.
Money talks bullshit walks
Bitcoin was never good for money laundering. You don't really want publicly available records of your laundering.
So, you’re not allowed to change your position after 6 years when things have changed and/or new information is available?
It’s not really inconsistent. also it’s an article from 2017 when the only notable thing about bitcoin was Silk Road and exchanges that disappear with your money.
A guy changed his mind over a span of 6 years with a whole bunch of new information. FTW?!?!?!
I mean 6 years in crypto is basically comparing finance in the golden 20s with 2000. The argument is even true, in 2015 bitcoin near only usecase was drugs and laundring. Nowedays you have actual investment possibilities, which is why banks started going into the market
He stands by his statement he just figured out a way he could do it too
The 5-year realization that they could've been laundering their money via Bitcoin long ago. But instead criticized it. Lol. Good ol' BlackRock. The 5th arm of government and controller of this little planet of ours.
Yeah well, he’d know
They are whores of money. So no surprise I'd say 🤔
They are consistent. They are pro money laundering.
 Government should disban blackrock.
They told you what they were gonna do and now they did it. ;)
Who doesn't love good old fashion money laundering with some etf /s
Lmao blackrock is the biggest scam in history
Blackrock be like: Consistency? Hold my beer, watch this!
Bitcoin scammers number one choice in getting money.
Old news
I like how he thought waiting a couple months shorter than usual assuming people would forget his previous statement..
Admission they launder money. Nothing new here.
They saw the money laundering opportunities and thought “we need to be in on this Jim”
CONsistency
wow
And Hunter wasting his time with shitty paintings 😂
As if BlackRock ain’t laundering Money… Who are you trying to fool?
If you got money to launder
What do you mean? He's entirely consistent- Blackrock just has a lot of money to launder now.
Fuck you for supporting them just because you make money from the pump.  **Blackrock FucksTheWorld!**
And nobody knows money laundering quite like Blackrock!  😂
I wouldnt mind watching everything related to blackrock fucking die. Except their support fo ukraine ofc
They are in need to launder money
Wait till you realise this has been done to suck the liquidity from the system.
Fink keeping it real.
Haha, move over Blackrock, here comes the WallstreetBets community! 🚀
He just realized there’s an opportunity to manipulate billions of dollars….
Wall Street, watch out! Blackrock's got its own fan club now!
Blackrock with the big brained 5D chess moves. Gotta play both sides to buy in very cheap lmao
1/2 of the bank ceos seem to change their mind on bitcoin according to its price
Oh, yeah. Always has been. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
LMFAO, FINK!
It's called to refine an opinion or instance. But it IS money laundering.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|31249)
the usual pushback and pouting until they see the profit at the end of the tunnel..
A lot can change in 6 years..
This isn’t inconsistent, to make money from ETF’s all you need is AUM, demand, you don’t have to believe in the asset.
OP doesn't believe in people learning new things over 6 years.
Well this is not a contradiction. He is not complaining.
he's not wrong  \shrug
U turn not allowed
Alot can change over 6 years
it’s called being fiduciary regards, they offer products they don’t invest their own money into them.  A store could sell products that with gluten even if the CEO is allergic
They said if anyone is going to launder money we want in!
not inconsistency.. He said it's money laundering index he didn't say he will never get in...
Don’t forget that the sec went after every competitor right before black rock and all the other ETF’s filed
“And for that reason…………. I’M IN!”

I'm investing in BR's tech term trust - if this timeline is as sleazy as it's looking, It'll be a glorious payout eventually!
Shit, when the idiots want to keep using their money in the crypto casino, why shouldn't they offer a service to do just that?
I’m not a fink, dig?
I'm happy to know that in en alternative universe my otherself is watching the FBI kick down the doors of Blackrock on TV, while drinking a bidlight, wrapped in an American flag.
6 years man
It's a good sign if you admit that you might have been wrong
They want to buy more at a discount.
Because in 2020 they realize how much money they can make with it.
I don’t think that’s the least bit inconsistent……
They're always most against us before they're with us!
Imagine complaining that someone learned a thing or two, or regulations caught up, over the span of 6 fucking years. How old are you, 13?
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Black rock and vanguard group is not a conflict of interests 👀 but your worried about bit coin 🤣😂
I know you are, but what am I? -Bitcoin probably
Polygon 📈📈📈
Just goes to show you how much can change in a few years
Well make sense since they got plenty of politicians in their pocket
Ponzi schemes are only bad if you’re at the bottom. Otherwise it’s literally the best business model
Too big to fail amirite?
Don't hate the player, hate the game.
Maybe Blackrock has nothing against money laundering?
Badmouth until they can buy it cheap.  Shame shame
Those two statements are entirely consistent.   Chinese real estate deals are a bedrock of money laundering...and Blackrock (like many other big investment firms) have exposure to Chinese real estate deals. Why? Because the only thing necessary for involvement is that there is money to be made...
That saying I keep hearing “the world is a stage” feels more and more real every day
It's only crime if you do it
Eh, 6 years ago. He prob didn't know anything about it back then and was just reactionary to it.   Now sees the dollar signs after missing the last 6 years of it :)
Crypto is a money laundering operation…..crypto is a money laundering operation…..holy shit….*makes a call* Yes we want to purchase coinbase.
U know when they are talking smack u should be buying right??? Have u guys not realized the media literally tells u the opposite of money making moves every time!
When Blackrock or anyone says shit like this know a run and accumulation is coming. Be prepared
Mine burned in the dryer and I don't see how the fuck this makes more money
I’m from Delaware and 40% of our gdp is from money laundering. Op is a broke bitch
Right. Man was just giving away free Alpha back in 2017
Car washes are the grandest of all money washing machines  W.W.
Yup, literally nothing he said in 2017 was wrong.  Bitcoin was and still massively used in blackmarkets and by criminals to launder money to by pass regulations and laws.
[deleted]
yup, it tracks with how they roll.
Just look at Deutsche Bank. That's their business model.
Yeah these aren’t mutually exclusive statements or stances
HSBC and WF’s dividends depend on it
Becase Blackrock is a paragon of morality!!!!
I think op is lost. Reality is what makes money.
[deleted]
Yeah you support anything that print, bash anything stop you from print, consistency
This is consistent though. It's still being used to launder money. They just want a sweet cut.
Came here to say this ^
OP's not the CEO of a company worth more than most countries...
Any good bank worth its salt follows the money. Whether they believe in it or not... well that's a different story entirely.
Yeah retail in crypto is like the easiest people to fleece now that nobody buys shitty NFTs or "virtual real estate"
Not OP, he has had the same values since conception…
Nothing indicates they changed their mind. Blackrock makes ETFs that make money. If they can make money with a money laundering index, they will of course.
exactly lmao. 2017 was quite a different environment for bitcoin and crypto  quite a lot has happend since then.   And to be honest, not a single bank or finance company wouldnt follow the money even if they believe in it or not.   Who the fuck cares what you think about bitcoin? People will buy the shit regardless of what you think so why not make some fucking money then
Let me know what you do, me do too…
Gotta do both. Play both sides so you always come out on top!
People absolutely launder money with crypto lol WTF? Read any article about a companies systems being hacked and held for ransom. That ransom? In crypto.  Edit: in order to spend ransom money, you need to launder it. I question the future of Reddit if that needs to be spelled out.
There are dedicated Crypto businesses that are specifically set up to launder money. What are you talking about.
Fewer than 500.
What changed? I see two independent statements that in no way conflict with each other.
"However, the SEC informed the exchanges that it had returned the filings because they failed to identify the bitcoin spot exchange with which they were anticipated to have a "surveillance-sharing agreement" or to include sufficient information regarding the specifics of those surveillance arrangements. Asset managers may amend the text and resubmit."  Sounds more like they gave the filing a "needs work" stamp than a final decision of rejected.
> Their filing was rejected by the SEC  Average wsb regard can't afford to read the article.
They should do it in Canada, we love pennystocks and shitty ETFs here.
Or is using it for his own money laundering operation
>Nowedays you have actual investment possibilities  😀😁😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣
>Bitcoin is not used for money laundering  Rofl
I'm not sure about laundering, but it's definitely not being used as a digital currency to buy regular shit. V-bucks have more practical uses than any crypto will have in 30 years.
You have to put it in the washing machine first
You need to get it more dirty first
Get a not-flammable dryer, dumbass.
You iron money. Don't use a dryer.
Use low heat, works like a charm
Those are rookie numbers, you need more laundromats.
I know it isn't a state, but I feel like Miami's is 95%
[removed]
Don’t really care if it’s used by criminals. Id rather have freedom than security for government and corporations.    On another note, between buying up entire neighborhoods to rent out and everything else, Blackrock should be banned from planet earth.
> The day an ETF is made, it'll quickly, if not instantly 10x or more.  Sounds like an easy buy for someone like me then
No, lol, that's not even remotely what happened with SBF. It was 100%fraud not a poorly managed business. That's the narrative he's trying to spin now cuz he got caught.     The stock market isn't a Ponzi, it's bigger idiot theory. The stock market as a whole has value behind it, Ponzi schemes require people to constantly pay in to pay out. There is no intristic value.     If you want a good example of a Ponzi scheme look at old age pensions in most first world countries.
Sbf was playing high stakes finance and he showed his hand. So they took him to the cleaners.
oil price *10? it is time to buy short it
> Oil money wants to buy BTC. >  > They can't buy enough to care without an ETF.  What's stopping them?
My friend, are you having a stroke?
Not very helpful though as people taking advice will sell low and buy high
I too do do to.
> Read any article about a companies systems being hacked and held for ransom. That ransom? In crypto.   I'm sure people do use crypto for money laundering, but this isn't money laundering.
More people are laundering money with USD than any other currency. What you describe isn't money laundering, that would happen after the ransom payment unless it just sits in a cold wallet for years like most of those articles talk about.
You understand people have been laundering money since the beginning of ledgers and it isn't something new that's just happening because of crypto.   Nobody with a money laundering operation is going to switch to doing it with crypto, period. It's obvious the people who don't have a fucking clue gat they're talking about when they say shit like what you're talking about. I know money launderers and they laugh at the idea of laundering money through a system that records every transaction in a distributed public ledger. Banks are much more efficient at laundering money.
The work they need can't actually be completed because no exchange meeting the SEC's standards will ever exist.
Your entire country's GDP is less than Apple's market cap. Canada is the pennystock.
And submarines
And dividends.
Canada could have brought in millions of refugees/poor people from around the world and charges them taxes and lived off them as employees but instead chose to sell out all the nicest and best properties to foreigners instead and now they are working for them... Should be a lesson here. Millions of poor are worth more than a few thousand rich.
I thought the people posting loss porn were dumb. It's the fucking crypto bros denying reality that are dumb lol Bitcoin is either held by true believers or used to launder money. And not much else lol
Low heat in the dryer. The cotton fiber paper US currency uses shrinks on high. Don’t make my mistake. All my $20s came out $15s.
I’ve been lobbying to change renter law so landlords don’t have to provide a washer/dryer but no luck yet
Fun fact, modern laundromats make more millionaires than any other franchise Opportunity.
Nah Florida in general specializes in fraud, specifically medical fraud
What proof do we have that these corrupt pieces of shit are accumulating crypto?
Crypto is tied too heavily to unregulated shitcoins that are providing liquidity JPow would cream his pants over.  Crypto is going to be doing an impression of 1929 within the next year

[deleted]
Buy it short? Nah bro… sell it long.
Why use lot word when few word do trick?
What?
Wait... there's another way?
Ok. After the ransom, what do you think they do with the crypto?
>More people are laundering money with USD than any other currency.  That's not what you said  >People launder money with USD not digital currencies that record every transaction.  That's what you said, it isn't true. People do launder with digital currencies. And yes, if you're demanding ransoms you're also money laundering.
The fuck are you talking about? Money laundering operations change and adapt all the time.   If you really think that there isn't any large scale money laundering going on in the crypto space you are just delusional and really out of the loop. Is it as of yet a majority? No. Are we still talking about billions of USD? Yes.  But sure if you are so knowledgable provide some sources and I will believe you.
Lower than MSFT and Saudi Aramco too lol.
Yes.
I am from a family of RE investors so it worked out great for us, but yeah maybe not the best outcome for the poor and the young.  Not like any government actually ever cared about them.
Lets just throw the us economy in a dryer to combat inflation
Don't forget to check your lint trap, you might find some loose change
That's how money laundering is supposed to work. $20 in dirty money goes in, $15 in clean money comes out. Science!!!
Haven't put mine in the dryer yet, but it still shrunk
I knew it. It's always the landlords.
Tell em “ that’s what your old lady is Fer”!
That's true, I just meant money laundering in Miami is insane
The attacks on the exchanges and the nebulous state of cryptocurrency being a security or not.  The fact that Blackrock is applying for a spot ETF (tracks the price of BTC).   The constant attacks that bring the price down.   Bitcoin is a means of control to the population, technology once again is used to better our lives and enslave us to the few elite in power as usual.  Once they accumulate (by confiscating and manipulating the markets) enough, they'll let it run.
Yeah, I watched a video about the brits pulling out of the ERM and Soros made a point that there was minimal risk of downside & lots of potential up side. Looking at BTC it's kinda the same, the amount of time it's been higher than it is today (~$30k) is like 5% of the time it's existed, so if you'd bought at any point in the other 95% you'll be up.
What part of SBF was using all of his depositors funds to gamble in high risk bets without having a license to do so, and while stating in eritting that they would not do this, while also prevented by law from doing this is confusing to you?     But hey, don't let s good narrative get in the way of reality, this is 2023 after all.
i feel very lucky. show me.
Oh shit, I didn't know I was dealing with a student of Kevin Malone.
An ambulance is on the way
🚑
I am that bitch, alright.   You follow my lead, ain't no one got there logically before me.
Whatever they want I assume, which could include laundering it. But again, the ransomware attack itself isn't an example of money laundering. You're just describing a crime that generates funds that would need laundering.  Walter White in Breaking Bad isn't laundering money when he sells meth for USD. That's just dealing drugs. He's laundering money when he makes it seem like that cash came from his car wash business.   They are two separate things that don't necessarily always occur together. For example low level dealers can perform the first crime (dealing drugs) without ever needing to do the second (laundering) if their cash flow is small enough to not draw attention.
The only people dumb enough to launder money using crypto are the ones getting caught. You don't understand what you're talking about lol  The idea that you think someone can get a ransom paid and it's public information what wallet is holding the ransom money and if they send it to any other wallet to try to split up transactions it's all recorded and on a public distributed ledger for the entire world to see. They will never get that money out of crypto and into fiat money which would be the purpose of laundering it. Any exchange or bank that would try to facilitate that would open themselves up to an obvious money laundering case. There's no way to launder dirty crypto money. The only people doing that shit are fucking idiots who get caught very shortly after.   Public distributed ledgers where transactions can't be faked vs shadow banking, hidden ledgers that nobody besides the conspirators can see with physical fiat currency that can be injected into the system through fraudulent and fake transactions. It's a painfully obvious choice and anyone thinking the former is an idiot who will be caught laundering money.
It's so painfully obvious you have zero clue how money laundering works lol there is a very specific process to laundering money that goes on and it involves injecting fake transactions onto a ledger that never happened. You cannot do that with crypto. Wash trading isn't money laundering, it's manipulation of the market. Not the same thing. Obviously there's fraudulent shit happening in crypto, doesn't mean there's any large scale money laundering operations happening in crypto though. There's absolutely no reason to launder money on chain when you can do it off chain with USD or any other paper currency.   You can look into how money laundering works by yourself. There are plenty of official websites that explain how it works and how it's not through wash trading.
No no I heard the economy is dryclean only
it would be fitting if the servicing laundromat is owned by a Chinese guy
We gotta throw a scoop of Oxiclean in there for the economy.
Alternatively, hang ‘em out to dry
This is the *only* time I have ever seen "loose" used on WSB both correctly and intentionally, and not just as a misspelling of "lose".  Bravo!
Costs more than 25% these days rip.
So, none.

Can't do anything before you launder it. That's my point.  Edit: [here](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/10/crypto-criminals-laundered-540-million-using-renbridge-elliptic-says.html) you go. Proof of the obvious.
>You don't understand what you're talking about lol  Pot meet kettle.
Try [reading ](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/10/crypto-criminals-laundered-540-million-using-renbridge-elliptic-says.html). They do it all the time. It's not all recorded afterwards if you know what you're doing. And guess what?! Hackers who've successfully demanded ransoms numerous times in crypto know what they're doing.
It is also painfully obvious that you do not understand how money laundering with crypto works. As I said. Billions are being laundered via crypto every year and the amount is rising sharply each year.  It is still a small amount compared to traditional money laundering but if the current trends continue that will not be the case forever.
Ahh, the only warning label that humanity respects, clever.
"Ancient Chinese secret, huh?"
Um, well...it s cranberry juice. Cranapple.
No ticky, no laundry
Shit I used oxycodone and my money disappeared damn
It was not poorly structured lol, it was intentionally structured the way it was to facilitate the fraud that went on. There's no arguing your way around that my friend.      He didn't take profits to gamble, he took depositors money and gambled it without their knowledge and in violation of multiple laws. He did purposely build the business from the ground up to operate like this. Coffeezilla has a nice breakdown that's simple to understand, you should check it out.      Is that how a bank operates, not really. The only people who think it is are people who don't understand how things actually work.
>I'm sure people do use crypto for money laundering  Quoting the very first thing I said.
Didn't even take two years for them to be exposed that's how good they are at it. Also they're not even laundering. They're just moving things around over and over again trying to hide it but they're not getting that money out. Nobody will do business with the known fraud wallets and assets. They're not cleaning the money.
Drug dealer has 1 million in dirty fiat money they want to launder. How do they do it through crypto?  Source on billions being laundered every year through crypto?
I specified why the thing I'm talking about is relevant to money laundering. So now I'm adding context to my quote. The article mentions what these people do AFTER they get a ransom paid in crypto. And it isn't stare at the crypto in their wallet.
Couldn't someone with a stolen / fake id still cash out crypto? I mean if all you need to open an account is a ssn can't you do the rest by Bitcoin machine? Aren't indian scammers getting away with it? I am sure you can find mules willing to scan a barcode and bring back cash for big cuts, there's always poor, desperate and druggies out there you can find and take off... obviously you could be caught after years but no different than cash laundering
>hide it but they're not getting that money out.  You seriously believe hackers demanding money never get it out and are just working for free? Lol ok. Have a nice day!
Funny how you want a detailed explanation now and sources despite providing no sources yourself.  https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/crypto-money-laundering-2022/#:~:text=The%20goal%20of%20money%20laundering,usually%20this%20means%20cryptocurrency%20exchanges.  https://syntheticdrugs.unodc.org/syntheticdrugs/en/cybercrime/launderingproceeds/moneylaundering.html
They use crypto because it’s a digital currency that can be sent anywhere across the world instantly with minimal transaction fees. Which sounds like a use case to me.  What they do with it after is harder laundering wise than if they just received USD
Sure but that cash isn't clean. That's the whole point of laundering is to clean the money so you can use it to buy real assets. If you have a million dollars to clean you can't just wash it through Bitcoin by buying and selling Bitcoin at an ATM. It will still be dirty money lol that's my whole point. The only way they can launder that money is injecting it into a real business.   What these other people are talking about isn't money laundering. The money being "laundered" in crypto isn't being laundered. It's not clean, it's still questionable especially coming out of a known platform that facilitates fraud. You can't just move money around through a bunch of apps and swaps and claim it's clean in origin.
What do you want a source on lol? The amount of alleged money laundering that is happening with USD? You've already acknowledged it's more than what is happening in the crypto space.  Again if you want to explain how someone with 1 million in dirty USD is going to launder that money using crypto I'm all ears.   You're talking about foreign hackers stealing crypto from exchanges and washing it through a system that doesn't even actually clean it. Good luck getting a bank to take your millions of dollars originating out of some sketchy crypto bridge service that is known for obscuring transactions lol. That money isn't coming out clean. People using those funds are so deep underground they probably couldn't even open a bank account if they wanted to. It's not the problem people are acting like it is.
Okay. I guess you have your opinion set. Have a good day.

He's right. Should have bought bitcoin instead
In his defense, the odds of Tesla pulling off what they've achieved were like a million to one.
I wish I wasn't 18 years old and didn't know Jack shit about the market at the time. I had $1000 I didn't know what to do with ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260) hindsight is 20/20

Cramer us being paid millions each year by the big brokerages to be a fool.  This is make millions of people believe “ he so stupid, I could do way better shorting BBY” 😂
For anyone wondering the gains you’d be sitting on if you’d bought at ~$1/share (split adjusted) back in 2010:  About +20,000%
Did he just say renting stocks🫢. Thats a first for him.
Guess Jim Cramer missed out on that one... 🚀
It’s IPO price was $17. $3-4 more analysts were expecting.
This dude absolute legend. Where can I follow him for more trading tips?
Any video when his forecast was right?
The only reason you listen to this man is if you want to know what poverty is like.
The same guy who said to buy Lunacoin and trust SBF and to invest in SVB.
Reverse Cramer ETF!
Biggest idiot in investing history. He keeps getting paid though
Every moron at CNBC tried to make Tesla look bad, they never understood what it was what it could be. Investors lost billions shorting the stock hoping for it to fail it didn’t it still remain one of the highest shorted stock in the market investors still hoping for Tesla to go under even when their battery technology as well the charging infrastructure is second to none.
Yeah he missed badly but to Musks credit he pulled it off with a metric fuck ton of help from the Government to his family wealth and all those people with all those good ideas that he bought up and engineers that worked their asses off for him.
The Fauci of investment advice. Whatever he says do the opposite.
Wonder what the loss count in dollars is for Inverse Cramer?
Tesla does have terrible fundamentals. It’s 99% Elon Addy hype
Him and Cathie Wood are two.of the biggest idiots in the market today.
Tesla is literally all hype. Crappy cars sold on changing the future when really electric cars have no place in society right now
The poorest people I know watch Jim Cramer.
Where are the regards who bought puts before delivery numbers? “Analysts” were super bearish… I know clowns here listened to them.
this man is a cash cow when you have your mind right and see it for what it is
Joker of wallstreet..a not so funny one
Actually, that makes sense. the model S wasn't out yet. it was still in development. but Jim Cramer is still an idiot.
How can you sell at the IPO without buying first?
Imagine being wrong every time you talked.
What a jerkoff. Think about how many idiots were listening to him back then. Its sad really a thousand dollar bet back then could have padded their retirement. They mistake people make with potentially disruptive tech is they bet the farm on one thing instead of buying a little to get their feet wet while they are becoming educated on the company.
🤣🤣🤣
Looks like Jim Cramer should stick to a different kind of 'car' advice! 😄🚀
Haha, looks like Jim Cramer missed out on the electric ride of a lifetime! 🚀
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
hmm,,, did tesla stock just crashed AH -25%??
Hahaha
Tesla Motors
I don't know if there's anyone who's consistently more of an idiot than Cramer, but there are certainly few people that I dislike more
At this point, it has become abundantly clear that he should be recommending ETFs and commodities - not individual stocks. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|31226)
u/savevideo
Guess that's why they say hindsight is a Tesla-saver! 🚀😉
There were plenty of reasons to believe Tesla would fail at IPO.
The legend of the contrarian investor was born right there and then
As funny as it is to see Cramer fail again and again, Tesla could've very well gone the way of Fisker or Solyndra. Hindsight is 20/20.
Jim should just fucking …..
I'm not an expert on investing but I don't think I will ever buy a stock on IPO again. I am four for four on getting burned by it. I would have been better off buying a year or two after in all my cases.
Since all of you brainiacs inversed Cramer back then, I imagine you have all gotten rich buying Tesla stock. Yeah, right.
Jimmy is the best inductor in the market he’s better then any TA- DD he beats everything just do the total opposite of whatever  he suggests & if do this simple task you be in the money in no time if he says sell you buy and if he say buy you sell that quick,  god I love this man 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Is there anyone who can do worse at his job than Jim Cramer? Maybe the weatherman, but even he is right 50 percent of the time. Lol. Inverse Cramer ETF gooooo!
Basically do the opposite of what he says and u will be a millionaire
Do exactly opposite of whatever he says
08-10’ Cramer was unmatched
Least he has been consistently wrong, how he gets paid to basically do zero and cost people money is crazy.
You scent learned yet, he is one of the problems
I bet he thought that "take it for a test drive" line was sooooooo clever
This is regarded af. As if people can't change their opinions when new information is presented. Cramer's wrong slightly more often than not, but what's the point of bringing up a decade old clip?
I remember that this was the year i told myself, if i ever do stocks i buy tesla. Started stocks 10 years later kinda hurts..
JC is WWF of investment.
😂😂 holy
Bro don’t remind me lol
Cramer admitted to committing stock manipulation on several occasions and didn't even get a slap on the wrist. Him saying sell it all is a buy signal.
How much would I have made with 2k at ipo date up until now?
No one believed a South African could pull it off.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|31249)
It’s still just hype
Thank you!!!
This Jim guy is my hero for missing so many calls yet still staying in business.
I remember this he was talking so much shit. He said the cars are catching fire and he advised his daughter not to buy one and everything.
I thought it’s a rule-of-thumb that the opposite of whatever Cramer says comes true.
One word of advice, if you are serious about making  cash for the opposite of this moron and you win. nough said!
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)![img](emote|t5_2th52|31249)
If I only bought 5000 bucks worth.
u/SaveVideo
If you do the exact opposite of everything he tells you, you will be rich.
Why don’t companies IPO like that anymore lol. Meanwhile we got shitholes like CAVA IPOing for more than RIVIANs current MC
Why don’t companies IPO like that anymore lol. Meanwhile we got like CAVA IPOing for more than RIVIANs current MC
u/savevideo
Last time I watched MSNBC, they claimed Tesla was shipping no cars. That was an obvious lie. Tesla just said over 466,00. I'm so tired of fake news.
Cramer told to sell rivian and lucid.
Scam artist and Wall Street puppet
Bro I’m praying he says to sell sell sell tilray.
Why is this guy is still employed??
Crammer needs to retire.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|31249)![img](emote|t5_2th52|31249)![img](emote|t5_2th52|31249)
He's literally making things up.
What a douche - just seeing his face makes me want to break something
He’s a entertainer and not a very good one, take his advice with a grain of salt and a shot of tequila.
Did he get kicked off of Squawk on the Street? Haven’t seen him on all last week
Hindsight is 20/20 and foresight is blind
So basically do exactly the opposite
I too think a company with a $2.8 billion market cap losing tens of millions every quarter is a good investment.
This guy is a  🤡 and a complete tool
![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm)sheesh
Does he not know he can buy short sleeve shirts …rather instead of rolling em up 🙃?
if rates were never near 0% for nearly a decade, jim might've actually been right for once
Jesus imagine buying that shit at that price lol
he was right - Teslas are shit
Sad. I’m sad.  I had bought some shortly after IPO for $25. Then it fell to $18. I sold for a loss.
What I find so offensive w Cramer is that he speaks w such confidence.  But that’s what entices the idiots that follow him.  Maybe, if he went back and admitted he fucked up I’d be more forgiving but there is no way he and his corporate overlords would allow that.  He‘s the winner here right? He’s rich, famous, and sleeps well at night.  We’re all going to be dust anyway, he’s just playing the game better than the  people who lose sleep at night trying to do the right thing.  I Hope his kids hate him but they’re probably in on it too. May God have mercy on your soul, but not his.
Omfg
What ever Cramer says to do, do the opposite and you'll do better than average.
Don't listen to speculators
r/agedlikemilk
It took like 10 years will Tesla to go up nobody was buying that IPO and holding
That guy is a noob
Cramer is failure in human form.
Just do the opposite of what he says!
This guy never misses 🤣🤣
I mean I wouldn't either. You'd have to have held it for 8 years from IPO to see any significant returns.
Follow Kramer, go broke!
That it, CNBC lets talk a deal
I balked when I couldn’t get google IPO at $100 per share. Wish I could travel back and punch myself
“Beyond the hype, there’s just not much going on here”  I mean, he wasn’t wrong about that. But enough hype can dupe a lot of people
Just do the opposite of what JC says
They pay bro to talk shit.
No normal being  should  listen to INVERSE  Cramer.
Between him and Catherine Woods... you'd be poor in no time.
Lol
How many days ago did he say to sell RIVN?
He's a hack and always has been.
Same goes for today, and tomorrow, and the next day and month and year.
So jimmy made tesla beat the odds... damn
Exactly. Same with Bitcoin. I remember the day Bitcoin hit a dollar and I read the article on Slashdot. I thought it was so goofy. I went back and read the article recently, and even knowing how everything turned out - it just wasn’t a convincing value proposition at the time.
exactly, too much bs in this sub
Yeah, same with Amazon in the late 90s, it was a joke to own shares
I mean even Charlie Munger said it’s odds of failing we’re greater than the pay off.
Yeah. If you're gonna shit on Cramer you should shit on his actual shit takes or when he's clearly shilling for his buddies and show guests.  TSLA IPO for $17 (Charts won't show that now due to splits) in 2010 and was mid even up to May/2019. It was only after TSLA proved it wouldn't be bankrupted by the pandemic downturn and EV push came hard that it really took off.   If you want to shit on Cramer you should find the one where he tells people not to buy TSLA in 2019 or 2022 lows. Unlike most regards on here I actually tried to do that. Results came back with him being [BULLISH on TSLA late 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXwilboQWvs). He's still wrong though since market AND TSLA were going to tank to shit in a few months.
Would like to see his take in 2012 and 2014
hedgies also don't bet on uncertain things. they often would wait until it passed their pricing criterion first. "I want to see it hit $20 before a buy." You can see this on articles, "wait until this reaches this higher price before you buy... because it could indicate people are starting to buy in..."  i find Cramer jokes funny, but let's be real a) 10 years is too long a timeline, for which he has revised his opinions on and b) it would have been worse to tell people to pump a new company and then it turned out to be a dump.
Especially with that idiot Elon who only made it happen because of a loan /s.
Cramer is not wrong... Tesla is all smoke and mirrors.  Some pork-filled government contracts and tech-bros have really done something special here.  Tesla has no business being the most highly valued companies in the world when the actual profits are so low.
In his defense you should be doing exactly the opposite of what he says anyways. He was tipping you off here that Tesla was going to be the million to 1 shot.
And he is the only reason why it succeeded if he had said buy it would Tesla would be irrelevant and not even listed on the NYSE
Thank you,  I  was literally typing the same thing and my regarded mind said... "read the comments " but I  agree with you 100%  The they need to post on here is what Jim Cramer said about ioniq just a few months ago when a caller called in about it and it was hanging around $8 ![img](emote|t5_2th52|31249)![img](emote|t5_2th52|31249)![img](emote|t5_2th52|31249)![img](emote|t5_2th52|31249)![img](emote|t5_2th52|31249)![img](emote|t5_2th52|31249)![img](emote|t5_2th52|31249)
It’s alright man, I wanted to invest in NVDA back in the early 2010s when they announced project Shield. I didn’t do that. I bought a ton of weed and mushrooms. It wasn’t the best choice.
I was the same with apple at $75 bucks.    If I had a Time Machine I’d slap the shut out of myself.
My gfs parents had some cash for her to invest and she suggested Tesla. They bought like 100 shares for her around this time. It paid off.
I regret not going long on oil with acouple of contracts and hedging my position when a barrel of oil hit -0.14 during the beginning of shutdowns due to covid. I'd be set for life rn.
If it makes you feel better I was introduced to bitcoin mining in 2011 and thought it would be a waste of time. To make myself feel better, I tell myself I would have cashed out by the time it hit $15 or lost my wallet key if I did hold onto it anyway.
You're still not late though, Tesla is worth $400 as it stands now.
How many similar opportunities are you taking advantage of now? That will grow 200x in a decade?
Uhh...just apply that same dumbass logic NOW with your smooth brain market trouncing skills to a company you believe will be the next Tesla.
When I was 20 Bitcoin was only 10¢. I was blowing money on poker
If you can't figure out that 1›260 is 260x, how are you logging onto your brokerage account?   Also, where do I sign up to your math classes?
Split adjusted
I love Cramer for the comedy/memes but he's right as often as he is wrong.  He makes 50 predictions/week and has been doing this for 20 years.  You could take any sports personality and do a compilation of the 500 times they wrongly predicted who would win a game
There's hardly any short interest and hope is not an investment strategy.
Don't forget straight up lying during his press releases. He even admitted that the fact he was so dishonest was the only reason why investors didn't bail
lol sure whatever makes you sleep at night
family wealth lol git gud![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)

Cope
He is that good ^(at being that bad.)
He has the power to turn a crap stock into the next Apple. He is truly gifted.
You have to be able to look back with regret but also brains. Like would I have dumped $1000 on a mythical currency that 99% of people didn’t understand and MANY people still dont? No fucking way. I had bills then, still do, which is why I don’t drop $1000 today on an alt coin.   I give all the credit in the world to people who were early adopters. But for every major hit they had, how much did they lose betting on other coins or whatnot? You gotta bet big to win big and they did, good for them. But I know myself and I wouldn’t have done it, and if I had, I would never have seen it through to 30,000 or whatever. I would’ve bailed at like 500 and laughed my way to the bank.
It still isn’t. You would think that with nearly a decade and a half under its belt, it would have developed some kind of adoption for usability. But instead it’s nothing but a 24 hour global gambling service.
When it hit $1000, I thought that was absolutely insane. But even that price level could have made me rich ;p  Hindsight is 20/20
Yup.  Somewhere in a landfill I am a multimillionaire.
No, it was a joke to own at 100+ in 2000. Two years later at single digits it was a much better proposition
Bezos himself told his early investors (namely his parents) that they only had a 30% chance of ever seeing a return on their investment.
Just stay on the sidelines till it dips to $1.13 again.
Yea it's nuts to me if you compare, for example, Apple and Tesla. Apple has an appropriate valuation. Tesla just seems like it's priced in for 5-10 years from now.  But it will probably 10x in that time frame and I'll eat my words. Maybe Kathy Woods will be right about something.
At least you had fun
Username checks out
I wanted to invest in NVDA when I was like, 20, because video games and I know their graphic cards, but I didn't know shit about doing it and never did with what little money I had.
Even in 2012, AAPL was looking like a snack. In hindsight, I should’ve sold a condo and gone all in, but that’s not how it works. You need like 20 years minimum in the market to even start getting an idea of what’s going and why people waaaaay wealthier than you are able to slowly milk your account.
Fr, don't even get me started on having an opportunity to but $100 worth of Corn at the time too
I had mined a few BTC back in like 2011 or something, sold them around 600 bucks each a few years later. I felt like a big shot. I stopped tearing me down for that, but man. That shit was brutal.
Yeah, my dad talked me out of putting $1,000 into Apple when Jobs returned when it was like $4 pre-splits (56:1). Was a good lesson, though. To be fair to him, Apple had a good chance of going bankrupt, if Microsoft hadn't stepped in.
I was 18 around 2001 - 2002 🤡
In 2010 (the same year as this Cramer clip), split adjusted AAPL price was around $9 and is currently $192. So, not as explosive as TSLA by an order of magnitude, but still a lot of growth
Sheesh
I just threw out my HDD with 32 bitcoins I mined 🥲
The next Tesla is not here yet on the horizon, for now I don't hear about any crazy founder like Zuck or Elon with his crazy idea of disrupting the market, shit like this comes once in a decade.  There are also turnaround plays like Intel and Disney but it's few years too early until they start digging themselves out of that shithole they're in.
Regards cannot count that high in green.
Right back at ya slick!
Family wealth lol win the sperm lotto try harder![img](emote|t5_2th52|31224)
No I’m saying you should always be buying bitcoin. In a decade, people are going to be saying the same shit we regards are saying now about bitcoin a decade ago.
You had me in the first part
*grifted
This. I hear people make similar remarks and I'm like, no you wouldn't have for those reasons stated and you would have never held it to this point either - not even close. The only chance you would have had is either being in a coma or dead. There are other hidden gems out there that you're not pouncing on because you aren't half as smart as you think you are.
> But instead it’s nothing but a 24 hour global gambling service.  Which is a viable model until people start losing their jobs and need to pay bills.
It has. It's the world's currency for laundering money, promoting terrorism and crime, and supporting evil regimes around the world.
It's willful ignorance to say crypto has no usability at this point.
Lol tell us you have no idea what’s going on outside first world countries without telling us.
Part of the problem is that governments world over (China India etc) have made it illegal so that they can control their currency (read demonetization in India). They viewed the Bitcoin as a threat to their control of currency leverage (M1,M2,Q1Q2 etc)
Monger is that you?
Yeah, I guess late 90s-early 2000s is a bit better of a classification of the timeline
Still a 100 bagger in the 100s so not really.
Tesla has a few big gambles that if one pays off will be huge. If more than one pays off, it will be insane.  Just think if tomorrow they released an update for FSD that fully worked in 99.9% of cases. How many businesses, people, etc will that touch?   Or when other Auto manufacturers start licensing Tesla's software. Soon Tesla will have an app store in their vehicles.  Battery storage and selling energy can be huge. Tesla Electric provider in Texas for now. Tesla owning Fast charging in North America.   Tesla has a Home HVAC/battery storage/heat pump setup in their back pocket. They first got everyone with their vehicles, now they will take over your home power. Aka expensive items.   The TAM of each of those points is freaking massive. If they can get first to market by a mile, their revenue and income will be a ton more than apple.  Apples most expensive item is a desktop rarely anyone would use and it's under $10K. With an average of $1k.   Tesla items sell for a shit ton more. They can grow revenue and income faster, just due to the prices of their products. Avg of $45-55k.
Shockingly, things seem to still be working for now!
$AAPL $CORN
Happens. I had a few grand in CVNA at $35, sold at $50 or so. That shit ballooned up to $350 within a couple years. Even when you win, you still can get fucked.
Nah. You’re dad knew. He was just still pissed for you ruining your mom’s killer bod
forgot we got actual boomers in this sub
I’d rather buy a blue chip stock with a dividend yield every week than bitcoin, because I’m not insane
The reasons it's useful for those make it useful for similar, legitimate use cases.
Bruh people moved on, monero is the new gold standard for crime
Bitcoin is not the only crypto and the argument was against bitcoin not all crypto
good luck using crypto when the government turns off the internet and electricity
>first world countries  You mean the countries that actually matter when it comes to financial power?
> Part of the problem is that governments world over (China India etc) have made it illegal so that they can control their currency  You make it sound like it is a bad thing. Do you have any idea how bad the alternative is?
Don’t make me have to tell you to get off my lawn.
Who pays divvies weekly?
I'd love to hear the explanation there. The fees and delays make most crypto (especially BTC) next to worthless for legitimate uses IMO. There are better, cheaper, faster, fiat options for legitimate uses.
It's willful ignorance to say bitcoin has no usability at this point.
That's a pretty solid argument if that invented scenario ever happens.
Yeah that’s what the price is telling you right?   Hundreds of millions of people create a market. Sorry you missed the ride.
Have you ever made a wire transfer? A normal on-chain BTC transaction acts very similarly to a wire, but the transfer costs <1/10 what most banks charge for a domestic wire transfer (let alone international), and it executes much more quickly. Wires typically can't be charged back, either.  Lightning can be much, much cheaper than that.
A good example I have seen:  Reputable, known seller has a painting worth 8k in a niche collecting group. He lives in Spain. He'll sell it and ship it anywhere. He wants crypto. Once he gets the crypto, no one can charge back scam him.
Bitcoin does have utility.  Blockchain tokens and crypto do as well.  That's why Wall Street is attempting the ETFs again. That's why the SEC is attempting to regulate them. The purpose is to remove current players from the field. This is a smash and grab for control being carried out by governments and financial institutions.
being the tinfoil hat wearing guy I am, that is what kept me from getting crypto.  Ammo, alcohol, and cigarettes are a better item for when the EMP hits
>  Have you ever made a wire transfer?   Have you ever written a check? My god it's so slow!!!  If BTC is hoping to replace wire transfers, I have to share with you that it's game over already. Maybe what, 0.0001% of all transactions are wire transfers? You have to realize your argument is a joke right?
That's not a great example. That can be done just as easily without crypto that's just one random guy being paranoid/picky.    &nbsp;   If I had a friend selling a painting for $8k but he'd only take payment in stride gum packs that wouldn't make stride gum a good/useful currency. It would just make that guy strange.
Western union can send cash to pick up at a physical location, and that's actually faster and cheaper than BTC. Also zelle can be done without possibility of chargeback.
I mean, yeah, checks are pretty bad. But ACH and wires are responsible for a lot more money movement than whatever you’re thinking of.  And it’s not only useful in cases where wires are used, it’s just a trivial counter example to “it has zero uses”. Just because you haven’t used wires doesn’t mean they’re not important. Personally, I wouldn’t mind saving $18 per wire, so I’d love it if more people used them instead of demanding wires.
That was an even worse example.  Lol.
What method would you use
"Sir you're dumb for wanting crypto. I have a much better system. Ok. We're going to need to Google which store near you you can drive to pick the money up at. We'll need to do this several times due to the limits."
I forgot to address your example suggestion of teller:  "In order to use Zelle®, the sender and recipient’s bank accounts must be based in the U.S."  https://www.zellepay.com/faq/can-i-use-zelle-internationally
It's a race to the bottom, when crypto is involved.
My point is it's not an example of bitcoin having some usefulness that traditional money does not. It's an example of one random guy having a preference.    &nbsp;   If I said I only want to be paid in Euros that's not some function difference where Euros are better than USD.
Actually the correct answer I should have given is wire transfer. That's how that kind of thing is normally done.
Currently yes. But what happens if investment banks get their ETF's?  What happens when the SEC forces players outside the banking system into insolvency and then lays out a regulatory framework? What happens after this while all the while other countries are doing the same to illicit control over the transaction and exchange of crypto?  That's what's going on right now. What's their end game?  Control it? Absolutely. Kill it?  Maybe. I doubt it's going away. Question is, what is the future landscape going to look like?
So you can't think of something better.  We can loop back to my comment that people saying it has no use case are willfully ignorant at this point.
Oh! A wire transfer!  Which service?
> So you can't think of something better.  Paypal, Venmo, Cash App, Zelle, any one of 100000 bank transfer services.    &nbsp;   All (except bank transfers) will be quicker, and all will be cheaper.   &nbsp;   Crypto's best case is still the same as it's been since day one. Tax evasion, and most people are using centralized exchanges anyways these days so they don't even get that.
Acknowledge the charge back scam point you regard
Which of those don't have charge backs?
Would you send $10k over Venmo or Paypal? I wouldn't.
Bro, this guy ain’t gonna get it, no matter how well you explain it.
PayPal absolutely. It'd feel weirder over Venmo, but I don't see why not. They're owned by PayPal too lol
But you'd send $10k over crypto? Lol
All of those have charge backs.   Bro
Of course, why not?
Good?
That was way too perfect
Still by far the best cinematic gasoline fight

I'm beary sorry... for absolutely nothing!
"You know what can really help you save your portfolio?"  A trip to Wendy's dumpster?
Love Zoolander!
Is that Alexander Skarsgard?
You bet against the gays going down?
Being -100% and still have this level of production value truly shows how regarded you are. Spent 10,000x more on this than DD, that’s for sure. Well done mate. Well done.
But why male models
They've gone completely overboard with restricting the app to try to get people to pay ever more ridiculous amounts.   The slutty gays are using other apps more and more (Sniffies etc), and the pretty pretty princesses are going to Tinder and will be prime targets for Match groups new gay app.  They're in late phase enshittification, and their performance in the next few years will reflect that.
Never go full homo.
Looks like the market got a little 'fabulous' with us! 😂🌈💸
You played yourself - DJ **KHALED**
You have terrible risk management
Sounds like you got fuqt in the @ss...
Whats grnd at now?
Upvoted! Very good OP!
Amazing edit. I was the OP who made the DD. It’s a long term play and I am still bullish on it.   A lot of ppl made money in the short term too after the stock rallied 8.5% in a single day
Should have bought some stock
At least you got screwed
Alex Skarsgård finest role
Dude is that a Skarrsgard actor?
Lmao this is why I come here, thanks!!
Wait a second! Is that Alexander Sarsgaard???
Zoolander is such a great, shit movie.        My grnd leaps still up,no stress. Young bulls and gay bears both have a place on grnd, stonks only go up.
Is that fuckin Alexander Skarsgård
This was the first DD that I read and KNEW to inverse you idiots cause have you ever even been on Grindr? That app is a hellhole of mismanagement and bad coding. Half the time it doesn’t show that your messages sent, the online indicator is 10 minutes behind, the adds are constant, and it often times can’t locate you which is the whole purpose
Should have bought some stock
This definitely has Old School WSB vibes!
Loved it! Still in! Do you plan to cash out?
Im waiting till July 21st to lose mine.
I thought this was a long term play, lol so we’re you actually up at some point?
They are not necessarily gay tho

Never gamble on the gays… you’ll definitely get fucked (budum bum 🥁) ok I’ll see myself out
theres no such thing as "solid fundamentals" when the client is a horny,loney person. they are just as much as willing to buy your stuff as to self delete.
It was an obvious PnD, some of us pointed that out in the comments on that DD.  But I must admit, the TL:DR was pretty funny.
You got the black lung
LMAO!!
I’ll tell you what’s not ghuey - that Bronco 🐎 👏🏼
Burn baby burn.
Greatness!
Well you still got fucked in the end, you can call it even I guess

Gay street bets
The irony of if you'd entered a gay 🐻 position on a gay company would've made you fat gay stacks.
Grindr is a penny stock that somehow trades on the NYSE.  It's very fitting considering the user base.
Did one of those stocks go backwards in time? 🤣🤣
thank you baby
Yasss 👏, bitch 👏, yasss!! 💁‍♂️
Yeah that made me chuckle 😂
OP took us on a wild ass emotional roller coaster ride.   The way I hollered woke up my sleeping fam. Including the dead.   We need some compensation. I hear there is a guy behind the dumpster at Wendy’s that will fix everything…for a tug.

Feel you. MTCH Group. Stonks only go up

I invested at a peak, bought 50 shares and a $7.5 call option, then proceeded to lose like 150 bucks in 3 days. bought back into it recently because it was on an uptrend again. I'm just gonna hold it, the time will pass anyways.
tim dillon is one of our premier homosexuals he is not wrong

Scaling out is far to advanced of a strategy for someone this regarded. They dont even understand that at some point you have to realize the profits by selling the position.  Certainly dont understand that anything over 8% profit is beating the market. Shoot all you have to do is break even to be more successful than 80% of this sub...

What I’m waiting for is meat-based plants
Is it because they're really expensive and taste like cardboard assholes?
Printing meat cultivation sheets is the safe humane and tasty path forward. Wagyu prints at 2/pound? Yes please.
Save a Plant - Eat a Vegan  \---------Thanks Jeff Dahmer
The products were always horrible. The future is going to be lab grown items. Meati is going to be huge, it is mushroom based alternative that they form and season to resemble meat. Then there was a company or two that got approval for lab generated meat (and these will likely even bring vegetarians back to the burger, as no animals were harmed in the making)  It is over for the companies that bastardize feed crops into some hidden crap that doesn't even closely resemble meat.
Who could have known this was a bad investment? - Tastes meh - Unhealthy ingredients  - More expensive than meat
Plant based meats are worthless because they don’t taste that good (yet) and they aren’t nutritious (for now). Maybe with enough investment and genetic modifications it could happen. But we may just get healthier, sustainable, and tastier animal cell grown meats first
Just eat turkey. Healthy and overpopulated. If i want plants ill eat a salad not a burger patty.
Let's see; Generic "breakfast sausage" 2.50$/lb, "meatless sausage" 7.50$/lb, I wonder why there is a bit of consumer resistance?

Eh. I don’t really agree.   Taste: I’ve had some pre packaged burgers from stores that tasted like trash, and I’d have much rather had an impossible burger compared to those. Taste is largely a preference thing, and on the whole the taste reviews of Impossible/Beyond have been mostly positive.  Unhealthy: This just isn’t accurate. I mean it’s not like you’re eating a salad, sure. But no one expects a burger to be as healthy as a salad. But compared to actual beef, there are some health related benefits. Lower risk of cancer for example. https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/impossible-and-beyond-how-healthy-are-these-meatless-burgers-2019081517448  Expense: This is technically true, but that’s also largely due to being fairly new and ramping up production. Everything is more expensive when it’s new, getting cost down requires time.  So sure, if you were looking to make a quick buck on 0DTEs you’re going to get burned. But I think insiders who have a good chunk of Impossible stock will be happy about their shares on a longer term investment strategy.
Yeah plant alternatives that aren't trying to be fake meat tastes better lol.
This stuff is highly processed and contains ingredients that are not healthy. Whole foods with simple preparation is what the human body has been processing throughout our evolution of roughly 300,000 years. Processed and ultra-processed foods began to enter the mainstream markets in the 1950s. There has been a large increase in obesity, hypertension, cancers, and many other mental and physical health problems that plaque our populations.
🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮
YOLO on Venus flytraps

Impossible is now out with a "light" version with significantly less sodium and saturated fat
Taste: You’re comparing cheap meat…compare to premium meat because that’s the comparable price point.  Unhealthy:  - Beyond Meat and Impossible Burger are just as high in total and saturated fat as their meat counterparts.  - They also contain more sodium than a single beef patty. - Some also contain added sugars and artificial coloring…a potential carcinogen. - Some also contain incredibly unhealthy additives like carrageenan and methylcellulose.
Taste wise, I mean, again, maybe you don’t like it personally, but reviews have broadly been positive. So I’m not sure your personal criticism of taste is really in line with the market as a whole.  As for “Unhealthy” saturated fat is a wash.   -As for sodium, most people season their meat with salt before they cook it, which isn’t accounted for on the raw meat packaging, so it’s not really comparable when you’ve got unseasoned meat on one side and a pre seasoned patty on the other.  -Added Sugars and Artificial coloring is just a lie here. Neither ingredient list has added sugars or artificial colorings. https://faq.impossiblefoods.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018937494-What-are-the-ingredients-in-Impossible-Beef-Made-From-Plants-  https://www.beyondmeat.com/en-US/products/the-beyond-burger  -Carrageenan is a seaweed extract widely used in the food industry. I can’t find any reputable sources that say it causes cancer or is unhealthy in any way. “Simply Health Vegan .com” makes that claim, but I can’t find any legitimate peer reviewed scientific studies.  -Methylcellulose again is very widely used in the food industry and I can’t find a singe legitimate source claiming it causes cancer or is unhealthy in any way. It’s even sold as a daily supplement.  You’re neglecting to mention all of the vitamins and minerals included in the Impossible/Beyond burgers.  And you’re neglecting to mention that actual beef has significant cholesterol which neither Impossible or Beyond has any of.  Again it’s a burger. No one’s expecting it to be a salad in terms of health. But on the whole, Impossible/Beyond are a healthier product than a beef burger.
Cholesterol is not bad for you. The standard American diet laden with processed ingredients, especially sugars is what interacts with cholesterol and causes the “cholesterol” related problems. Whole food diets that include red meats are not inherently bad for you. Human “innovation” will cause many more negative health effects than sticking to more natural diets. I know it’s hard to believe that 300,000 years of natural evolution should be ignored and our 200 years of chemical science and 70 years of food processing knowledge should replace all of that because killing animals hurts your feelings or whatever your emotional hang up is.
Look I’m just presenting the facts as they stand.  Your argument about taste being “meh” doesn’t line up with the reports of what most people are saying in the market.  Your argument about cost is misguided when you’re comparing something new still working on development, to an old established industry that’s well optimized.  And your argument about health is flawed. I’ve pointed out the issues with your arguments. Claiming things like carrageenan and methyl cellulose are “bad for you” isn’t supported by anything. What they have spooky names? Some “health food” “all natural” froo-froo sketchy websites tell you they’re dangerous and killing people? Wow. Real trusted sources of information. Definitely going to take those seriously.  Look I don’t really give a shit about your diet or your investment strategies, but the facts you’re using to justify some of your claims are “ThE vAcCiNe iS kiLLiNg pEoPLE” levels of stupid.  Talking about “300,000 years of natural evolution being ignored for 200 years of science” is nonsense and gives an insight into your thinking. Are you one of those paleo idiots?
Yes. You are clearly full blown vested in all of the “science” that money buys and see no flaws in the vaccine or a fucking meat factory. I support your right to get 17 boosters and eat chemically processed sludge that they tried to make look and taste like meat. I’m just not going to do it. Enjoy your premature osteoporosis and dementia. I’ll keep active, eat whole foods, and enjoy the benefits of not being a science experiment.
It's extremely doubtful China will restrict export to Taiwan. Despite what the media and the US government says, the business relationship between the two is extremely strong and getting stronger.  This is targeted at American companies like Intel not TSMC.
I know nothing on chip supply chains, but I imagine that chip companies will stock up on the critical supplies and source new channels for it, so it won’t just hit them hard post august
This is going to be a lasting problem across the entire tech sector. China accounts for 90 something percent of gallium production globally
bullish
The supply is limited and not elastic
One sec, let me slap on the old *expert at random process materials* hat here...  Only limited by margins. These are byproducts, currently it's not profitable to produce them because china tanked the market to control it.     If they try to limit supply it will make it more profitable elsewhere, which will begin to produce it.
Does DPST stand for dip shit?
Disclosure: I have several regional bank clients. I don’t know if the CRE-exposure is the big problem people think it is - it gets headlines, people point at guys like SCHW and MS and scream “Eek!  cRE!” - but IMHO, the bigger drag on something like DPST may be the need to offer competitive rates for deposits while not loaning as aggressively as they were doing.  So they’re paying out 4+% but customers aren’t lined up for loans at 6%.  If / when rates stabilize, IF we’re not in recession, then businesses will be looking for loans again.  In the meantime, possible that regionals’ profits will be slim (AND may have CRE exposure)
Dyslexic veterans struggling with this
Those types of ETFs will go to zero if pricing remains constant.  Look at any chart of the leveraged bear/bull ETFs.
Not a fan of regional banking stocks right now  Especially with the commercial real estate shit  TQQQ SOXL
Dipshit? Dude, I’m all in on Dipshit and buy the Dip-shits.
OP’s obsessed with dip shit 🤣
Anything 3x leveraged is really more meant for trading than investing. That said 47 looks like a pretty decent entry so as long as you're green and think it'll go higher keep holding. If it goes all the way to breakeven I'd sell, but depends how much risk you're willing to take. Keep an eye on it every day.
I would just get $kre instead of dpst. All the volatility/decay is really hurting dpst
What about Tmf?
just do some 2024 and a few 2025 calls might just print
Idk… what do you value more you’re money or the fun swings/risk you’re taking… given the fact you’re on this sub I think we all know the answer
It had a reverse split - that's a huge red flag and all I need to know
Anagram of $PTSD. Nuff said
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640)
Short term? It's a party just starting. Mid-Long term? Get the heck outta there. Regionals were a bad buy before March ever hit them. Dropping deposits, increasing rates making people not want loans, and giant debt from commercial real estate backed up. There's also no way for a lot of that commercial real estate to be converted into anything else because of residential codes. So it's literally just bad debt.
You should have just bought long-dated calls on strong regional banks in March. You’ve already missed some of the recovery.
The best option would be to buy options on it for short term gains and cash in big. A long term hold would be more like this 🤑🤑🤑🤮

First thing that came to my mind.
It youre referring to yourself I could say so
Thanks!
U think those are better than dpst?
Never knew a less volatile version of dpst existed. Thanks but no thanks. I’m here for the SPICE
Not yet… wait until the rate hikes are well and truly over and long-term treasury yields are above short-term ones. I think it’s range-bound until then.
Yeah def not long long term but send the calls for a few months
Like holding bbby
Buddy I move stacks where’s your Porsche
Not at all, im referring to the one pushing dip shit.
Anything is better than $DPST.  Over 5 years DPST has lost almost 80% of premium.  DPST would be a good moonshot play if you think the regionals are going to recover soon and start making money.  But they aren’t - the cost of funding is way too high and it’s going up.    So yes, TQQQ and SOXL are better choices for now.
Fair enough. I'm sure with earnings coming up soon we're gonna see a lot of volatility
If price stays the same it decays over time and can reset through reverse splits hence the prior prices looking super high
> Never knew a less volatile version of dpst existed.   the guy making this thread and (poorly) trying to persuade people to go long.
Should have been sending them since the 23rd (~26% of moves already made). We got a few more DAYS and then tread carefully. We want to see it push beyond the daily high once it takes a breath in a few days. This is a very risky thing to be in so I'll probably go to daytrading only after this next drop.
Fuck your Porsche, this is Lambo country.
Nah I’ve been watching dpst for months I feel a crash coming. It’s either going to push past or fall back to what it’s been doing. Stop loss is very important, and I will be watching it at every second of the day while my money is in it.
What makes you think it will be worse next week though. This stock has always been RISKY
We had convergence on a lot of timeframes on be the 23rd making it an obvious reversal point. It also was moving higher on the weekly chart. It's about half way through the move up on the daily. You will definitely see a small pullback while the little guys run and the big guys buy lower. Everything is pointing to higher but I'm not a fan of playing at the top of a daily move. I'll play it super cautious after this week while I look for the next reversal play.

Space is for pussies real men go to the bottom of the ocean
I wonder what made them choose the PornHub color scheme?
They were happier when they were poor.
YTD everything looks sexy. Their fortunes were down bigly as of Oct 2022
All stuck in stocks, worthless statistic.
It's ok, we are reducing their numbers by having them fight each other to the death in gladiator matches.
Now compare that to 12 months and you'll see they all have lost money in that year timeframe.
Not even a trillion, what poors. 🧐
It’s always funny to me that in market years like 2023 we see these posts, but in years like 2022 when their fortunes are down by these amounts we don’t see as many posts.
Cool it’ll trickle down any day now.
Guess that’s why Elon doesn’t give a shit about crashing Twitter when it’s basically a drop in the bucket for him
This is almost all equity based.  Nothing to note here in terms of their actual power or quality of life, as any attempt to sell would pop the bubble and cost them most of what they have.
Guess how much they lost in the first half of 2022?
Like fuck, I get the hatred of Elon. He's a fucking clown.      But holy shit, bezos, gates, musk..   these guys changed the world in positive ways, the valuation behind their names is because they made human lives easier, better, or will be doing so in the future.  SpaceX making delivering goods to space significantly cheaper than NASA, and thus making things like starlink and general exploration move up in the grand scheme of things is a net positive for humanity.   I don't believe we will see mass adoption of EVs because I don't believe we have anywhere near the infrastructure to support it.. but the ball is now rolling. Bezos, the Walton's, etc made goods for the average consumer cheap and convenient. That imo is detrimental to the economy (people bitch CONSTANTLY about wage stagnation, yet send as much of their money as humanly possible direct to foreign entities and manufacturers just to save a buck cutting out the local middleman, then wonder why there's no money in their local economy to pay them more money every year) but you can't sit there and say "these people did nothing".       They created huge value, and the wealth that is tied to that creation of value exists for a reason. All the angry fincels who will never get past an entry level position because they offer nothing and clock watch all day seem to think if they were forced to liquidate somehow society would be better off, as if the only thing that matters is the spending of money on things.       Like one comment pointed out the education system has definitely failed, but not in the way they were implying.
I don’t even see a point in trying to be not poor anymore.

Plebs
Just adding more marble to the meat
Nice. I added some peanut butter but I only have about half left.
You mean, those guys are bagholders !!!
Numbers on a screen gains
Nice, why did they cut out my name tho?
And the National debt is up $851 billion.
Cuz everyone in here just throws calls calls calls. Tank . Shit. Shit
God I love giving the really rich my last few cents
Guess we'll have to work harder on our meme stocks, guys! 💸😂
Looks like Jeff Bezos borrowed my piggy bank again! 😂🐷
Talk time out of of the how we don’t make more money!?  New war will be against, all the abusive billionaires…
Go to a non union state and you will be able to buy a home for mega bucks less thank you non union businesses.
Um yeah. That happens when most of their net worth is in company stock and the market goes up
I didn't know how many liberals we had here. All whining about being poor basically.
This is no longer shocking, just sad.
Damn, same
All of them working a billion times harder than the rest of us
Imagine gaining 100B. Like what the fuck do you even do with that type of money? I get it’s not immediate liquidity, but still god damn. You can have and do literally anything in the world. Where would y’all start?
Big deal I just saved tens of dollars on my car insurance by switching to geico 🦎
Good, rich people deserve it
Is that all??? I hope they're OK
How much did you add to your fortune in the same time frame?
Fuck them so hard lol
"Hoarders" should do a season about billionaires.
Guess I'll just stick to buying lottery tickets then! 🤷‍♂️😅
And yet during this time people have convinced themselves that papa Elon is an idiot...  What's his return on investment, regards?
Elon is the best proof that money doesn’t buy happiness. Made over 300b in the past year and is still a miserable hateful internet troll whose family hates him
Congratulations to them 👏
Each of them should receive an OceanGate vacation package for their accomplishments in excellence.
I’m happy my 401k contribution can is all retire in 40 years.
How much more obvious can it get? They are creating an extreme wealth gap to make a full slave class
Cool so we can tax them more?  Oh, give them tax break….wait….![img](emote|t5_2th52|31224)
As a worker you are not able to earn as much, they feed of others working hard
Ya right. It’s about 100x higher than that. Most of their wealth isn’t even documented and is hidden in off shore accounts.
Billionaires shouldn't exist. Multi millionaires? That's good but BILLION? These people have more money than multiple generations would ever spend, yet the poor people are responsible for funding infrastructure and other programs through taxes. Elon is literally almost at 100 billion dollars net and I GUARANTEE he pays less taxes than any of us. I'm not a communist or anything but I do have a brain.
Nice to dream of becoming billionaire The reality is the rest of us would be better off if we didn't allow them to exist
So can we kill elon??? literally.. like he needs to be ended for society to continue right???
Good for the Eppstein Avengers
Good for them. They need it.
This is BS.  Doesn’t mention they were off substantially from their ATH.
If only we could also build multi billion dollar companies and own a good share of them as they do their thing.
Good for them
Good for them, livin’ the dream
Why is this on wsb I don't give a fuck brokie
Inflation 🤷🏾‍♂️
And how rest lost
Doesn’t really mean anything other than they held.
The *Trickle Down Theory* was one of the greater lies ever told.
It's worth noting that they have lost money over the last 12 months, Tech took a severe decline in 2022, and started bouncing back in 2023. All of this wealth is relatively illiquid as it's just their ownership share in the companies that they started (inb4 Tesla/Elon drama over him coming in a year after Tesla was started as a hobbyist company)
The only trickle you are getting is the white stuff coming from your girlfriend that was produced by another man.
Someone is getting fucked 🤡
it’s a real eye catcher
Tbh that's probably a decent marketing scheme, don't give a shit about color theory, you just caught a lot of people's attention.
yea all those dudes come from notoriously poor backgrounds
They can be down 99% and still be richer than everyone here
Seriously, and it's litterally after they lost billions when tsla, meta and amzn crashed down to double digits this year.   What's this dumb cuck gonna post next? Gas prices went up 500% since 2020? Because it did, but only because gas was a dollar from everyone stuck at home
![img](emote|t5_2th52|27189)
paper money as they call it also there's no way they can liquidate that much in any way
nice logic "its not in cash therefore it doesnt matter"
Try to be stuck in cash and the IRS will fuck you to death moron
Nope their moms say no
Fight to the death on a titanic submarine. Winner gets to hold the controller.
People do like to ignore the fact that a significant portion of that wealth is in semi liquide assets like shares. Anyway at that level of wealth it doesn’t matter how much you have in your bank account but how many 0s are beside your name and if you were to try and convert that wealth into cash you would loose a shit tonne of it
bruh. looking @ ur post history ur invested in tesla, so its already trickled to you. no?
they can take out loans against it tho
Even if they have a 95% drawdown on paper they are fine unless they loaned too heavily against the earlier higher paper figure.  E.g. there's not a bubble solely because Elon owns a large part of Tesla, although it's certainly true a fair portion of the present and future value comes down to having a competent CEO. Liquidating his share simply involves finding the right set of buyers that can absorb that size, it's done all the time.
Really impressive in "only" 1 month...
For now.... 🤪
\-$100
-$900 ):
+50%
Maybe 18k ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Now try to say it without crying.
Every VisualMod comment I’ve seen lately is a regurgitation of whatever the post says. Am I just now noticing this or is it new?
Incorrect. They feed off of the rampant consumerism of the average American.  Want billionaires to stop getting so much richer? Stop buying stuff and participating in our capitalist society. Otherwise shut the fuck up. They will continue to get richer because people continue to spend.
That’s not how that works
Imagine typing so much bullshit and not being right on ANYTHING you said.
No, not right
And generations of poor regards actively voted to cripple the public good in favor of excessive private wealth concentration at the top, because they believed their sacrifice would bring them salvation later due to neoliberal economists seizing their religious upbringing.
Yet, a shockingly large number of people still believe it
There is no trickle down theory it is literally a joke made by a comedian.
Quick serious question:  I got hired as an apprentice electrician for a non union shop in February 2018. After the tax cuts in 2017, my company hired a ton of green guys, took on a ton of additional jobs, and damn near doubled in size  I was making $16/hr at a restaurant when I got hired. I didn’t even own a screwdriver. I make $50/hr today with a respectable benefits package  Am I a trickle down success story? Or am I the result of coincidental timing and good luck? If it’s luck, why did the whole US economy rip face in 2018, with the median household income going up a *significant* amount along with it?  Was the US economy in 2018 and 2019 ripping face *in spite* of the tax cuts? *Because* of them? Or was it all just a coincidence?  From my personal experience, it really feels like those tax cuts lit a fire under the economic potential of most Americans. I don’t really think I’m special. I think my opportunity was simply better when my boss has more money in his accounts. It was easier for me to call dibs on that money
It really is and people licked it up like shit on the ground at a Wendy’s dumpster.  Yeah yeah give these fat hogs even more and their cup will run over. Wait nope they got another cup….fuck!
You must have never been in a position to control the nozzle. It absolutely works.
Everyone here + everyone on 9gag + everyone on 4chan + 88%of the whole wide world
If you’ve already paid taxes on it and keep it under your mattress in cash no matter how much you have it’s totally fine you fucking idiot
Precisely ![img](emote|t5_2th52|27189)![img](emote|t5_2th52|27189)![img](emote|t5_2th52|27189)
Starting too.
Lol. Cute
Adding to the conversation with additional relevant information. Congrats you’re learning what ai is.
Most people have to work hard in order to be able to buy products to consume.
Yes it is WEF boy. You can’t be that dumb.
I'm not saying it to be right or wrong it's just what I think bozo
And the best part? They are still actively voting the same way.
"After leaving the presidency, Democrat Lyndon B. Johnson alleged "Republicans ... simply don't know how to manage the economy. They're so busy operating the trickle-down theory, giving the richest corporations the biggest break, that the whole thing goes to hell in a handbasket."   https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1973/07/the-last-days-of-the-president/376281/
By comedian, do you mean Reagan?
Yeah you’re likely an [ancedotal](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/amp/economy/making-sense/did-trumps-tax-cuts-boost-hiring-most-companies-say-no) success story.   Nothing wrong with that at all, congrats on such a positive shift in income.
Congrats on the wage increase! I get what you're saying, but it is a false equivalence. The reduced proportional increase in workers' wages over time should be compared between wages of those with roughly equal rank and experience and then indexed to inflation.  Comparing wages of your different jobs across your career isn't helpful in this respect. Your wages increased drastically after you changed careers and gained skills. The real question is, how do wages in your industry compare to the average of those who worked 10-20-50 years ago?  For example, in 1970, the average electrician made about $14,100 per year (US Dept. of Labor, 1971). In 2021, the median salary* for electricians was $60,040. That's great, right? Wrong. Adjusted for inflation, the 1970 salary is equivalent to $97,574 in 2021 dollars. In other words, in real terms, salaries for those with equivalent experience have dropped by over 38% over the last 51 years.   *I know median is not equivalent to average, but they're usually close and I couldn't find equivalent stats on short notice.
Perhaps it was the nearly free money from the Fed.  Also, forty-five years ago I was making 6-8/hr in a restaurant. I then went *White Collar* and magically my income also increased.  Compare the value of my 6-8$/hr and your 16$/hr *forty-five years later, also no student debts and investment fix-er-up realestate could be had in many parts of the country for 1500-20,000$ and some,  just for an assumption of the mortgage.*
Compare that 50/hr to what union labor was making in the 1970s after adjusting for inflation.  You're doing fine, but you should be doing better.
I think you’re regarded
ya you were the minority there bud congats tho
Somebody doesnt understand what "anecdote" and "statistics" are.  Debt and deficit got worse, business investments went down. Many top corporations on average got effective taxrate of 8% which is far less than what middle class people are playing. Oh are you a communist now to suggest corporations are not people? Wages were flat, but .1% wealth exploded - your anecdote doesnt fit into that statistic.

Congratulations on your good luck.  I went into non union HVAC and made garbage money.  I’d have been a moron to not go into the union if I stayed in that career.  Sounds like the owner of your company was a good person who cares about his employees and chose jobs which all the green guys could handle.  I hire all sorts of construction trades now, mechanical, electrical, civil etc building manufacturing plants and I know I wouldn’t take a bunch of green tradesmen onto my jobs. But that’s just because the jobs require a proper chain of command and experience.   Now the HVAC company I worked for was a corporation. And they did not mind keeping all the money in their pocket, and just paying my dumbass a poverty wage with the hope that one day I could get a promotion and make money on commissions.
Started in wet utilities destroying my body for $25H, Now I’m a soils tech for a geological firm, testing sidewalk (SG) for a school, making 72$ plus mileage/maintenance +401k+health and paid holidays. Idk if this is trickle down or just me networking never settling for anything/asking questions/listening with my eyes
You're in a liberal area that actually pays it's employees? I started as an apprentice electrician in 2018 and made $15/hour.  Now, 5 years later I'm a mechanic making $22. Yay, Florida
Any time you experience any success in life it's 100% luck, or you ARE LITERALLY STEALING EVERYTHING FROM EVERYONE. because you don't give it away.     These potato's constantly bitch about everybody else's wealth, can't articulate how a fucking number beside Elon musk's name has any negative impact on their quality of life, argue incessantly that the rich all don't pay altaxes while simultaneously bragging about all the ways they get out of paying taxes, refuse to acknowledge the top 10% pay 80% of all income taxes paid, constantly declare the middle class is shrinking when the published numbers show thats true, but it's because the upper class is expanding at 2x the rate the lower class is expanding at. Refuse to accept that 80% of millionaires and 60% of billionaires are first generation, and most of the companies that were number 1 a century ago either don't exist anymore, or were cnanhbalized by new companies so bad they are shells of their former selves.. which kind of kills the whole " the rich have all the power and prevent anyone else from having success because they control the entire system"     They also think wealth = cash on hand and are dumb as fuck.      Don't sweat it though, most of them will never amount to anything because they are so busy creating excuses and complaining that they won't ever figure out how to actually get ahead. Congrats on the trade, and don't waste time on the rest of the noise.
Same here. The tax cuts mostly benefitted small businesses. My business quadrupled in size overnight. Big corporations weren't paying the full tax rate anyway. Democrats fought those tax cuts all the way. Never will I vote blue again.
I agree with your thinking,  I had the same experience
It's one of the never-spill cups that feed back into itself
Our cups don't spill.
I know it worked for *some.* For the vast majority of knuckle-draggers who screech to the heavens praising *Trickled On Theory,* not so much.
Paid 40% tax then leave it under the mattress to decay 5% per year compounded ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|poop)
what type of reply is this.
The first two sentences are pretty much straight from the image.
Your point?
I generally try not to buy into high level conspiracy theories. And yes I have seen the Panama and Pandora papers but there is not the mechanism in this world to create and hide 900 billion in a year. Their wealth isn’t based on anything tangible but by how much people think they can sell their shares to others.   There was the beginning of a correction in the valuation of these companies in 2022 with some of them falling from returns on capital employed of over 40 years but a milder than expected recession meant the market has turned bullish and is becoming another bubble. Their wealth isn’t theirs, it’s based on an idea of future value and if they try to cash in to too high of a degree their wealth will fall
Trickle down economics never existed, it’s a satire of supply side economics (usually). It’s Easy to criticize and joke about because it is a joke invented to be easy to criticize
30-40% of the population doesn’t understand the difference. That’s why the right is pushing so hard to break our education system.  It’s going to be a challenge to push the right wing policies if the electorate has a strong basic education. It’s just be bad for business.

I agree. If you live in the US, then you, and everybody else, are given the tools to achieve success. People just don’t know how to use them.
I hear ya, policies don’t work for everyone in all circumstances. I think the alternative view (and tough to refute) is that the knuckle draggers have job opportunities as a result.  We have record low unemployment based mostly on 6 years of economic growth friendly tax laws.
And there’s three sentences….lmao

Keep on telling yourself that. Would you prefer *Voodoo Economics* as Bush The First preferred to call it, or  perhaps Reaganomics?
Pigman has no clue how the world operates.  He would rather have inefficient government spending drive economic activity vs private sector.
Not only that but Betsy DeVos, only the richest cabinet member in US history, only a member of by far the richest most elite presidential cabinet of none other than - Trumps.  Isnt it odd when he promised to drain the swam he only did the opposite? Projection is helluva drug.
Perhaps the end of COVID supressed demand and low interest money from the Fed?
Bot doesn’t need to summarize everything before getting to the point. It’s not high school English.
Newsflash 900B isn’t that much these days. Heck they print a trillion a week and take a hefty cut did you forget that already? Remember there is no such thing as a bubble or inflated stonk prices… because ponzi fiat is intrinsically worth zero and printed from literal thin air.
Imagine being this pressed over a comment made by a literal robot lol
I’m just curious, imagine caring this much about someone asking a pedantic question.
Chinese infrastructure money might actually prop Zimbabwe back up longterm. All the corporations are moving their labor to Mexico/Vietnam/India but where else is cheap labor? Africa. Where is an abundance of natural resources? Africa.
I heard their companies make trillions in revenues
For whoever is wondering why is this happening, it is mostly because hyperinflation, check Turkish and Venezuelan stock market and you will see something similar. The "increase" of the value is simply on paper and not real.
Now that's a sure bet if I ever saw one!
How tf can I buy into zimbabwe? Gimme a ticker
Brace yourselves, folks. We're about to make Zimbabwe's stock market roar!
Doing good both in market and cricket 🏏 🔥
All them email princes are making a killing
african stock market always does well, but its not in US-Dollars.  I have some shares of a nigerian beer brewery for lols, they made several 100 % over the years, but  in Euro Currency they were only up 20 %. Naira  (nigarian currency) is not the best currency to have , if you want to learn about a shitshow of a currency, google it.
If that is in zimbabwe dollars its not really growing then. What is it indexed in?
I tried this after college with the Mongolian stock market because I was in south Korea and every news article was about how awesome Mongolian investments were doing. I threw 2500 bucks in and the inflation rate alone ate away my gains. I think I cashed out for just under break even after a decade 🙃
Can’t possibly go tits up
OP closed his eyes and pointed ‘anddd im losing my next pay checkkkkkk there’
I’d rather invest with the Nigerian prince’s personal stock picks
Count me in! Let's make Zimbabwe's stock market great again!
TIL. My dumb ass thought ZIM was a shipping company that I’m bagholding….
Ahhh yes buy at ATG and sell at ATL, this is WSB way ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
That doesn't look like escaping inflation to me...
North Korea's revenue are all-time high, you can see my man Kim throwing rockets all day and having fun
Wait a fucking minute...Stocks can go *UP*?   Bullshit. I don't believe it.
Made Billion but still oppressed which is horrible
look like perfect time to buy in
Zimbabwe is reaping the benefits of Chinese triggered investments. The republic of Zimbabwe will soon be renamed to ROC.
US market is the same just a little slower. Like it is orbiting the sun at the speed of Mars.
Sure, till government falls
Why doesn't Zimbabwe do what other countries have done, and just adopt US or China currency officially?
Oh my gourd
Literally regarded. I love it. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Amazing brb going to buy Zimbabwe
It’s a good time to buy high and sell low!!!
So this is happening in several countries.  Is there any way to work investments without using the devaluing currency?
Brace yourselves for the wildest rollercoaster ride, folks! Zimbabwe's stock market, here we come!
time to exchange all my money for zimbabwe dollars
But if we all buy can we short squeeze it?
Que opina
dónde puedo invertir
I have a have $50,000,000 Zimbabwean dollar bill framed on my wall.  It's worth about what a tourist will pay for a souvenir.  The inflation rate is like 10,000%.
Time to short it
Short
This will surely end in generational wealth
Can a person buy puts for those companies on IBKR? Asking for a friend.
You can’t get the money out or at least you couldn’t a few years ago. The only way was to buy old mutual shares which were dual listed in Zim and South Africa.
What could possibly go wrong here.
'Made in Africa's already basically the 'Made in China' for non-high-income countries, and also especially for China.
Chinese Infrastructure and long-term are not words that should ever go together
They have tried it before and moved back. African workforce is inefficient and uneducated compared to like likes of India and China.
OP is highly regard (unless he's a Zimbabwean living there). Not a bit regarded, but regarded just enough to think they are smart. In many ways those cats are the most regarded.  They LITERALLY know that ZWD is going into heavy/hyper inflation. They know that the stock market is only going up due to inflation. Yet they are too stupid to realized buying into that market also means selling whatever his currency is buying ZWD. Any outsized performance will be nullified if not outright turned into a loss or wipeout due to currency devaluation. Same shit as the other regard who recently said the Japanese markets are "outperforming" the US when the JPY went from 100Y:$1 to 150:$1.  Also dumping your toilet paper money into toilet paper stocks isn't that much smarter. Given Zimbabwe's history and general shittyness? Better to sell and buy USD/Euro cash or bonds, gold, or invest in a truck or plane ticket to fucking leave the place. Heck even bitcoin would be better than Zimbabwean stocks, Blackrock owns everything and plays all sides (that's why they always win like how they had exposure to the shorts, had shares of the brokers, AND was a top 3 holder of GME stock in 2021) but even BLK doesn't have [an etf with exposure to Zimbabwe.](https://etfdb.com/country/zimbabwe/)
This is wsb its perfect
Será que sube
You're right, the stock market in Zimbabwe is definitely on the rise. However, I'm not sure if amateur investors are really the best people to be trusting with their savings.Tienes razón, el mercado de valores en Zimbabue definitivamente está en alza. Sin embargo, no estoy seguro de si los inversores aficionados son realmente las mejores personas para confiar sus ahorros.
Apple will be a small cap company in Zimbabwe
Forget the companies , I got 10 trillion in my wallet, but that's the old money. Unfortunately I'm expecting to collect the same in the "new" currency soon
I’d argue the same is happening with the US market currently, just to a lesser degree
Hypothetically speaking , can you beat this with leverage so that you earn more then the currency devalues?
The increase is *real* in the domestic currency, but if you base it in USD or another stable currency it obviously is different
$ZIM
Psst, don't tell anybody here
Nigeria isn‘t a kingdom, they don‘t have a prince.
They’re not escaping inflation they’re escaping gawt dayum orbit
Zimbabwe officially supports a ‘multi currency’ system - i.e. local Zimbabwe Dollars, USD, SA Rand etc
There’s one way - take out a loan in Zimbabwe dollars, immediately convert to USD and sit back as you inflate out of repayments
Ahh yes the age old tradition of labeling what continent an item was made in.
I've got some leather hiking boots from South Africa that are pretty legit.
Even if you live there, you are better off investing in the US
The vast majority of investors doesn't grasp the concept that stock prices are nominal. WSB was buying puts when inflation was running at 7%. Later everyone was shocked that earnings did not decline.  I used to post Turkey and Argentina stock indices to make the point that inflation lifts stock prices. All that falls on deaf ears. These graphs are helpful even if posted for the wrong reason. Might save bears some money.
100T dollar bills back on the menu boys!! Let's go!!!
Thank you for taking the time and explaining this to the bot.
So short them then?
I carry a 50 trillion so I can do my "grumpy boomer shakes fist and rants about fiat follies" bit    I also once gave one to a police officer after he issued a warning to us out of staters. I said consider it a souvenir from our visit. Or make up a wild story about 50 trillion for your coworkers. He got a big laugh and we smiled and went on our way.
Everywhere else but Mexico this is happening. And to a lesser extent yes also Mexico.
Ha! In the uk we have inflation and flat markets!
Not even remotely the same lol   Inflation has been steadily decreasing...
Currency short.  That’s a good idea.  If you have any info on getting started, please let me know.  In seriousness.  I’m interested.
Least racist Asians 😂
Much easier said than done - the sad reality is that it’s almost impossible for Zimbabweans to get their USD out of the country in any sizeable quantity. For now, the stock market represents one of the safest ways to at least hold some value.
In theory, earnings should not have to decline in that environment for stocks to drop. Risk free rate rising should reduce valuations significantly enough with flat earnings.  Anyone who thought the earnings were gonna fall off a cliff during inflation is regarded. Inflation happens due to demand outpacing supply.
La gran mayoría de los inversores no comprende el concepto de que los precios de las acciones son nominales. WSB estaba comprando opciones de venta cuando la inflación estaba en 7%. Más tarde, todos se sorprendieron de que las ganancias no disminuyeran. Solía publicar los índices bursátiles de Turquía y Argentina para señalar que la inflación eleva los precios de las acciones. Todo eso cae en oídos sordos. Estos gráficos son útiles incluso si se publican por el motivo equivocado. Podría ahorrar a los osos algo de dinero.The vast majority of investors do not understand the concept that stock prices are nominal. WSB was buying put options when inflation was at 7%. Later, everyone was surprised that the profits did not decrease. I used to publish the stock indices of Turkey and Argentina to point out that inflation drives up stock prices. All of that falls on deaf ears. These charts are useful even if they are posted for the wrong reason. Might save
There's always the slim demographic actually buying real property, or real property backed assets.  Unfortunately it's Zimbabwe, land of unstable legalism.
“OP is highly regarded” then proceeds to mansplain a bot. Oh boy
I have like 100 1 billion dollar bills or so left, I like to hand them out to people and welcome them to the billionaires boys club.     Women can come too, ofc, this is ,2023 but bbb just rolls off the tongue.     Always been a great icebreaker, fun party gimmick, and good networking tool.
You are highly regarded
Number go up slightly slower than before still means that number goes up. Just not as quickly as before.
Lol so I actually live in Zimbabwe and I am doing this exact thing. It’s very common for those with the ability to take zim dollar loans - in the last 12 months, the large manufacturing company I work for has made considerably more profit through currency arbitrage than through manufacturing. It’s high risk though, about 6 months ago the government hiked interest rates from 60% to 200% overnight. You can imagine the effect, everyone scrambled to close their zim dollar loans the next day, which in turn actually deflated the zim dollar rate, exacerbating the problem. Crazy stuff.   Anyway, as a non resident and without the right connections it’s unfortunately very difficult for you to secure a zim dollar loan. There’s also a lot of nuance in the local zim dollar to USD dollar rate, so there is potential to get hammered on interest as well if you don’t know what you are doing. Probably safer to stick to yoloing SPY puts.
wait.... if inflation causes earnings to go up more than normal, and low interest let economy strive, doesnt that mean.... stonks always go up???

To celebrate this great American 🇺🇸 holiday  I am going to have BBQ for dinner, which is the tradition  Korean BBQ that is 🤤
I swear to God I just watched a video where a delivery guy told a woman "fuck you" because she tipped him $5 on a single pizza.  That's at least 20 to 25%.  Shit is getting crazy out there.

I always find it weird that ppl hate on the U.S. like I know it isn't perfect but it's a place where a child of immigrants (me) can grow up poor af, live in shitty place, have a pretty shitty childhood/upbringing, not go to college, join the military, and then get out and start a successful business and have a pretty decent life. Maybe it's just me but I don't think my story is unique.
Lol it’s just green everyday. Honestly this is even more epic than the 2021 run.

Outside of the actual “will VR be successful” conversation, the tech in that apple headset is probably going to completely revolutionize first-person experiences in gaming.   The cameras inside that track your eyes, absolutely wild. The headset saves on processing power by only fully rendering in 4K what you’re currently focused on.   The periphery is still there, but less in focus and less rendered.   That’s *much* closer to actual vision than a box of perfectly clear imagery from a first person perspective. Shit’s gonna get pretty cool over the next 3-5 years.

Sitting in a line at a gas station. One register open. Line building. Old lady is paying and says, “let me see if I have a penny.” Old lady proceeds to look for a penny for 10 seconds and then grabs a quarter and hands it to the cashier and says, “guess I’ll give you that and help you with change.” What the fuck does that even mean? You’re a good person because you gave the store a quarter so they wouldn’t run out? Fuck off. Get out of line. Hand the cashiers dollar bills and chuck the change in your center console. Stop holding up lines at gas stations. Fuck your rewards points too. Remember this when you are out and about today.   MSTR to the moon

Good morning. In less than an hour, aircraft from here will join others from around the world. And you will be launching the largest aerial battle in the history of mankind. "Mankind." That word should have new meaning for all of us today. We can't be consumed by our petty differences anymore. We will be united in our common interests. Perhaps it's fate that today is the Fourth of July, and you will once again be fighting for our freedom... Not from tyranny, oppression, or persecution... but from annihilation. We are fighting for our right to live. To exist. And should we win the day, the Fourth of July will no longer be known as an American holiday, but as the day the world declared in one voice: "We will not go quietly into the night!" We will not vanish without a fight! We're going to live on! We're going to survive! Today we celebrate our Independence Day!

Usually, the number of fireworks and explosions is non-stop. Last year it wasn't so loud. This year I've only counted three fireworks. People don't have money to send up in smoke.

#1.1M NET WORTH BY 25 IS A MUST
So I am testing out a bot that I created using chatgpt. I have a background is SDE. So far, the bot’s portfolio is up 34.24% YTD. Don’t ask. The bot is no where near perfect and not user friendly. I’ve only been working on the backend. There’s still a lot of human intervention, so you could say it’s bias. Now the bot is telling me that $TSLA will go a high of 294.50 this week but the bot is also signaling the border market (spy,qqq,etc..) is signaling sell off or lose in momentum to the buy side. So I don’t know what’s the play here. Just putting it out there so that I can come back to this next week.
TSLA is undervalued. It will be a multi trillion dollar company one day
Picked up an extra shift last week, so all I have to do is make it through one more shift and I finally get my first day off in almost a week. Just gotta survive.

I did not realize there were lanes inside a store, just said sorry bro while trying to avoid his cart. Billy stared at me and said: you want to get out and fight, let me kick your ass! My brother needed a case of water in like 10 minutes, I did not have time to do bullshit there, so I just told him I am a jiujitsu pro, can snap his fucking neck in two seconds. The moron tried to fight me inside store, his wife grabbed his arm saying dont try to get into trouble, you may land in a jail, while I was running out asap. Penceland is fucking scary.

Honestly that sarcastic Holocaust joke by Roseanne was probably the funniest joke I've heard in years.  Dudes you're allowed to joke about your own cultural group dammit! Good on her!  Holocaust denialism IS hilarious she's right. Anti-semites should be made fun of because they fucken funny, not have their freedom of speech taken away.  ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
I bet 4th of July events would be way more fun if you didn't have to think about winding up as a gun violence statistic  or is that part of the experience idk
Why I'm working on July 4?  Because I'm a responsible adult, and don't need like 80 days of holidays off every year like they get in America?
who is downvoting on a holiday smh  Not cool bro
I’m not gae but where are the cute twinks at? ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)

Is it weird to go to the fair with your parents in your late thirties?  Feel like my social score took a hit
Very cringe seeing these new tesla simp posts after buying calls while its green and saying how its the  leader of the ev industry, when months ago they were probably talking about how shitty of a company it is
I have the opportunity to get a promotion making 15k more per year, I’m making 120k which I just got a promotion 3 months ago from 95k.  I’m still getting my footing in this new job. I want the money, but that’s all.  The job would be much much more stressful and I would be highly scrutinized. I’m thinking peace of mind and sanity is more important.  Or do I bite the bullet, stop being a puss, and go for the $$$$. What do you broskis think

tbh Tsla delivery wasn’t bullish  it was driven by western market and not Chinese market, which is most definitely the growth story   India is not it sorry to break it, no land no resources    but maybe US EU importing increasing amount of migrants could continue the growth story and avoid economy fallen into recession

Explain to me regards why TSLA receives mad hype in share price for completing backlogged orders at discount. The new production figures only account for a 9% increase in production since Q4’22. Margins were already seeing downward pressure. Elong is getting ready for bad guidance going forward, (competition, losing first mover advantage, quality problems, same old look) wants to build hype around the software (too bad he laid off all those autopilot workers in june 2022). Ford predicting boosting EV production to 600k for 2024 and 2mil by 2026.   Call me a 🌈🐻but I’m struggling to see the long term value for TSLA. Pls tell me what I’m missing so I can justify getting on the free $ call train.

Ughhh - My dad was rear ended earlier today - He took the license plate and insurance information. The other driver's insurance card expired in 2022, so we were hoping that "that" was just the document they had on hand at the time...But no, our insurance co. researched, and said that the other car was uninsured.  Luckily, he drives an older Honda Accord. Does anyone know whether using the "uninsured motorist" part of your insurance will cause your premiums to go up?

My dad got rear ended today by a F-150 (my dad drives an older Honda Accord)...He seems to be in good shape, but his Accord is in rough shape in the back. I already took all the pics and did the initial claim with Geico. My dad thinks the person that hit him was an illegal immigrant...The person's family came to the scene and provided the insurance. We have the license plate, VIN, etc., so there's no running away.  Car aside, since my dad isn't in the best financial shape, I'm debating whether it would be worth it for him to "lawyer up," and to maybe claim that he hurt his back/hip/etc. I don't know...We'll have to see.

Americans who talk shit about America are 99% middle class high schoolers that have never had a hard day in their life.   Imagine living in the USSR in some unnamed city working at some factory and then you die from anthrax inhalation cuz there’s a leak at the secret bio-weapon lab upwind.
Yeah, but what if you blow it? Blaming some external villain beats blaming yourself. If you blame yourself, it means you can take a different action and improve your life, which is a ton of work. If you blame someone else, you can sit around doing nothing and complain on Reddit all day.
well the data shows the majority of americans got worse in the last 40 years  mostly caused by the internet but also gyna
Same story just one generation further out.  Grandparents immigrated to Washington state during WW2, my parents made their own shoes from farm animal hides, no running water etc.  I grew like a king in comparison in a run down trailer park while both parents were in military Nam era.  As a teenager we upgraded to a lower middle class house.  They are multimillionaires now and have been for the last decade.  Setting the stage to give a better life for their kids/grandkids via education etc.  Unfortunately I learned about options and will be learning how to make my own shoes soon.

Had this realization a while ago  Tough to be the ideal person when you’re surrounded by unideal people and unideal circumstances
My ex was the same way. Emotionally destroyed, no self confidence whatsoever. Spent 2 years together, building them back up, only for them to put me down every chance possible, eventually cheated on me and called me worthless. So you can imagine my hesitation to put myself back in that situation.
Welcome to the club. 35, was in the same boat, to extremes.   Once you break that conditioning of "i feel bad because I'm putting myself first finally" you're gonna wake up one day and be like "Holy shit. I'm happy!"  TSLA 300+ EOW

Idk just a human measurement is all
I'd say it's a measure of tiny, equal, repeated movements in a pre-defined space. This is because the concept of time itself is wrong, or merely a simplification. Only space-time exists, time outside of space is irrelevant because it is impossible, so it's always relative to space. So really, when you calculate time, you are simply measuring movements (like a clock ticking, or if analogic, electrons moving inside a computerized system) across space. As space morphs and curves, so does time, or in other words, movement. Einstein proved this, but what's interesting is that Greek philosophers way before modern physics were already unto this, for them, time and movement were linked, in fact movement was at the origin of time.
One of those things like gravity, matter, and energy. What do you want to know about it? Read Skaughterhouse 5 again or read some Allen Watts ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|table)

Fattest wallets and 🅱️enis
>fattest country in the world.  Nauru   According  to data from the World Health Organization (WHO), the most obese  countries are primarily located in the Pacific and the Middle East. The  Pacific island nations of **Nauru, Cook Islands, and Palau** have the highest rates of obesity, with over 30% of their populations being classified as obese.

Just like that guy earlier talking about financing $1.1m with 5.65% interest. Assuming he has impeccable credit, would it not make more sense to wait two years and save an extra 3% ? I think so.

Dude. Find a beater Civic with like a D15 or something and learn stick and work in it. Engine bay is simpler than most Lego sets.
There are worse ways to waste your money.   On the bright side you'll learn all kinds of maintenance fixing everything that breaks on your shitbox.  That era of vehicle is super easy to work on though so you have that going for you.

Costco
No choice for me today.  Costco closed.
Last time I was at Costco I had a lil fender bender.  No damage, just a scrap on the chicks plate.  Got out to look/trade info and the chick, rather large, no joke saw me in my jeep with a hotdog and said no problem if I hadn't taken a bite of the dog - I hadn't.    TLDR- Bigger middle aged lady didn't want insurance info, just Costco hotdog...

Give up while you’re ahead
Pick a few companies/stocks that you trust will continue doing well in the future, have a history of consistent growth, have predictable non-volatile patterns over the course of years, once you got that just follow the trend and wait for opportunities to jump in. If it’s been on a bull run for 3-6 months and there’s no indication of it slowing down, wait for a dip and get in there!

Depends on whether it is American or European style.  *Typically*  all index options are available for exercise only on the expiration date (European), while equity options are all *typically*  exercisable at any time throughout the life of the contract (American).  By *closing*, you may freely open and exit positions as often as you like, assuming you meet PDT regulations or are trading an exempt instrument such as Futures.

Lawyer up. It won’t affect the person who hit you besides their insurance going up which is happening anyways. Your dad should get the maximum of 25k if that’s the minimum in your state. After lawyer and doctor fees around 15k. If it’s 15k in your state then around 8k after lawyer and doctor fees. 6 months to a year until settlement happens if it’s not an extensive injury.

You know that semi-boney part of your chest?  Somebody told me it makes a popping noise when it ruptures.  Bro, you wanna see my knife?

There’s some weird benefits for American citizens you wouldn’t expect. If you register with any American embassy in any country you visit, they’ll send a helicopter of Marines to rescue you in an emergency. Heart attack? Military coup? The best military on the planet will airlift you out for free. It’s much easier/cheaper to secure the bag upfront, than trying to save you from a political prison.
Yeah, but the men are fat and ugly too. You can get a fat, ugly American partner or get a thin, hot foreign partner who wants a green card. It’s your choice. That applies to both American men and women.
Lol that’s bold coming from someone from one of the poorest places on Earth. But who knows, maybe they’ll be the new America in 50 years 🤷‍♂️
![img](emote|t5_2th52|27189)  Edit: Honestly, that’s the most important reason. But I like the whole democracy, capitalism, and individual liberties/civil rights/human rights answer too.

They are the best place to stop on a road trip. The bathrooms are huge and clean. Lots of cold drinks, snacks and brisket sandwiches. Lots of gas pumps. Dog park, so the pupper can pee. Lots of parking. Huge convenience store, so whatever you need is there from firewood to fishing stuff. It's like going back to the 60s when travel was fun and exciting.

Nothing wrong with the good Dr. Being a Texas native, I prefer a cold Dr. Pepper over a Coke.
I bought the COVID dip with 500k, then found the GameStop craze. Turned the 500 into 1.2m and have been chasing it ever since.
I had a few hundred TSLA 150 calls for July I bought in January. Sold for a small gain the same month.  Also had several hundred Spx puts in March during the banking debacle. Went from 25k to 325k. Lost it all within days.

LOL tesla does not own the vehicle market and they never will. Ford has been around for 120 years and isn't going anywhere. They have consistently great products and are a major player in the EV game. Personally, I would choose 2 or 3 Ford products over any Tesla right now. Plus Elon has been making a complete fool of himself lately so who knows what will happen in 10 years. Ford on the other hand, has had great leadership for a good long while now and it seems to be paying off. Ford will sell probably 10 times as many F150 Lighnings as Tesla will sell Cyber trucks, if not more. Normal people are not gonna buy that monstrosity, its wack man. You think gramps is gonna buy that or the F150 he's been buying since the 1950s but this time with an electric motor and a battery?

Rare earths are almost everywhere but not in quantities where extraction is worth it  Just like there's gold in playground sand but it's not worth enough to make the process economical
Not this time my man.    “Gallium occurs in very small concentrations in ores of other metals. Most gallium is produced as a byproduct of processing bauxite, and the remainder is produced from zinc-processing residues. The average gallium content of bauxite is 50 parts per million. *U.S. bauxite deposits consist mainly of subeconomic resources that are not generally suitable for alumina production owing to their high silica content.* Some domestic zinc ores contain up to 50 parts per million gallium and could be a significant resource, although no gallium is currently recovered from domestic ores. Gallium contained in world resources of bauxite is estimated to exceed 1 million tons, and a considerable quantity could be contained in world zinc resources. *However, less than 10% of the gallium in bauxite and zinc resources is potentially recoverable.*”  This doesn’t seem to be like lithium where it’s everywhere and we just have to deal with a few bad actors funded by China to make up a story about a Native American battle on a mountain. This seems like a fundamental heavy lift.

good idea.  If he pretends he's no longer capable of having intimate relations because of injuries sustained during the crash he can claim even more.
If he lawyers up, he’s suing the other guy’s insurance but not the other guy directly
Maybe it was a dick move to slam into his car from behind while he was driving slowly (5-10 mph).
If he isn't actually hurt, I agree

> Nope. It is still considered a crime for military personnel. If committed, they would be subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) Articles 134-138. >  >  >  > UCMJ can apply to all US Military personnel anywhere, anytime.  I would swear I've read that it's common for US sailors when they dock in certain countries where it's legal.

I agree with everything you said, except your first sentence.  When I said, "TSLA does own forward-looking market share"  I'm simply referring to the fact that TSLA's market cap is currently $886.89 billion, while Ford is only $60.97 billion.   So yes, they do, by about 14.5x.

You don't understand how much theft affects the bottom line because you're not a business owner.  Retail has exploded and made a massive comeback the past few years for reasons you don't see because again you're not a business owner, they're not closing because of slow sales.  Theft will absolutely destroy a business and make it no longer worth operating, it doesn't even take that much.....I've seen it happen first hand to where even though the business was doing decent numbers sales wise there was still garbage profit overall because of theft.

If it hits $35.70 at expiration, your breakeven, the contract will be worth the debit you paid to purchase the right to sell 100 shares at the strike price, leaving you with net $0 gain/loss.  You may close your contract at any time to collect the difference in price from your original debit.  You may exercise at any time, but you must carry adequate capital in order to handle the shares (no freeloading!)  If you choose to do nothing and the option ends ITM, the broker will sell your position to prevent exercise if you do not have adequate capital (frowned upon but not illegal), if you do have adequate capital, you will be assigned short 100 shares at your strike. If the price is above your strike, it will expire worthless. You always lose the debit paid to open unless you sell the contract back to close, FYI.

All publicly available information is reflected in the price of any given stock before you even have a chance to react, given the efficient market hypothesis.

Fucking this!  Some people are strait up victims no matter what the circumstances they’ll seek out victimhood and that becomes their skill.  Others spend their entire life preparing for the next struggle even when it’s time to relax.  Has to be a balance but we need more people pulling the cart then riding in the cart.

Yea, I am leanings this way as well. It just seems most people don't care these days. On top of that, not sure how I'd even go about making deep friendships at this age now. Guess all there really is to embrace the loneliness and stack money.
I let my hatred dictate my generosity or lack thereof.  I used to feel bad about it until nothing changed, so I did.
Totally get it. As someone who tossed away about a decade of my life and basically all my 20s to being depressed and emotionally dead, I get it. Much love to you and I sincerely hope things turn around for you ❤

Maybe move back to cali in a few years(4-6 years) when rates  go back down and house prices goes back down since no one can afford to buy a house unless they make a joint income of 150-200k
Yeah it's kinda a sticky situation. My mom is sick tho and I wanna move back to take care of her sooner rather than later , she would let me stay with her obviously. I'm not married or anything and no kids so I really have no obligations to work but I'd still like to

Sorry can’t share the algo because I am not allowed to since I am in a team. But here’s a tip. Try out strategies that works well together and group them. It’s all about data. You can start seeing some patterns. And the truth is there will never be the perfect strategies or the perfect algorithm. It’s all about probability.

Me:  not profitable, no existing infrastructure and minimal feedstocks.  The implication is 10 years to suck-start a crappy leaf blower.  We’ll pay S Korea and Ukraine (?) to ramp up existing production first.  And someone mentioned Australia.     Are you defending your bags or actually having a conversation in good faith?
The single bulley theory (1 bullet passing through jfk, into connelly, and then out of him and into his clothes, making all the turns and hitting all the parts needed has been shown to be "possible" although the warren commision had disagreements amongst themselves.   What's important, in my view, is that the bullet was found, intact, on a gurney in the hospital a few hours later, and there was testimony that the governor never rested on that gurney That's not proof of a second shooter, but it is pretty clear evidence planting.  Thats why I said the bullet evidence they have made public is impossible.
You’re right bro 🤔

Probably worse, based on the trend.  Until I hear otherwise, China has the market cornered.  Russia has another 1%, leaving just 2% from Japan/SKorea.  I’m looking.  It’s a good question.    The key loophole here is that China Mainland doesn’t make the GaAs wafers, so it’s mostly Taiwan…. 😬  Side thought - At what point does economic sanctions look about the same as Taiwan-invasion sanctions?

Society has become more narcissistic and self centered with things like social media etc. People will ignore true mental well being for the sake of some likes online. They’ll sell their friends out to be liked or accepted by the random masses   I keep some people around, but I stay aware of their level of empathy. Always have to be careful of those people that are self centered and fair weather friends
Yeah, you can only let your caring make you feel bad for so long. Eventually you realize shit isn’t changing, so you have to adapt.  The dream of a better way should always stay though
Lol my 20s are pretty much done. Have a degree ive never used and sacrificed 4 years for the wrong person. So yeah you can understand my depression.

Sucks man. I know I should let go of all these fake people, but all my life, all I really wanted was to feel like I belonged and was accepted. I always wanted a tight friend circle, where everyone would look after one another. I don't know why, but it does sting me quite a bit that I don't have a single person like that, even tho I gave it my all to be there for people who I thought were genuinely, real friends.
For me, the better way was to stop wasting time, energy, and money on people who didn't deserve it.
I meant no offense.

I like most games but never liked RDR2. It’s slow and the shooting mechanics are bad imo. If gaming was unhealthy for you I don’t want to be that guy that brings you in. But, if you can keep it healthy I think there are some great experiences out there.  Personally, ghost of tsushima, god of war ragnarok, persona 5, elden ring, re4.. all have been amazing recent games. I appreciate the effort into all aspects (music, visuals, sound design, mechanics etc.) Also maintain a regular gym/social life  Anyway, if it’s not healthy for you personally I get it. Self moderation is important
Not my thing bro

Yeah, that’s possible but also outrageously stupid. High risk pregnancy. Good chance the kid will have disabilities, too.
You seem really pissed about this. That's weird. Im just saying if someone, anyone, were shot today, and the police produced the bullet involved in the murder, in the same way and condition as in the jfk murder, it would, at the very least, not be admissible in a court of law.
Wise man bro. Yeah it’s good to be upfront honestly. That’s a skill I need to learn
The problem is it might squeeze tons of shorts still

500 shares at $15.46 😎 Not exactly gain porn, but enough for me to rub one out…  https://preview.redd.it/joxqtil6ns9b1.jpeg?width=2688&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5b5ed686dd34f4f1f9d5f7287a0b0199e220afb1
Thanks for boosting my calls 🫡
$100k in to make so far $300... oof
Nice work. Don’t listen to a single bear cuck here. I opened a $50,000 RIVN position a few days ago (made a YOLO post) and am up 150.74% as of market close today. This company was extremely oversold and has drastically reduced its cost of goods per vehicle sold, and it makes possibly the best EV in the world. The product is amazing.  I said I like RIVN to $22-23 by end of July when it was trading around $14 a few days ago, and to $40 by September. Those are still my price targets and I ain’t selling
congrats on the 300!!!!
Sold calls and shares this morning after that awesome Q2 deliveries update for some sweet tendies! Decided to open a new position shares only but I ruined my 18.94 cost basis on 3300 from earlier today :(.
RIVN is sitting at 11 B cash and they just delivered above market expectations and they also affirm 2023 Production Target, game on Baby
You are supposed to buy BEFORE it jumps
Distinctly possible a short squeeze is about to happen. Short interest had been building recently, now up to 3.4 days to cover, and RIVN now up about 35% over the past month.  Probably not a whole lot to move the stock until August, other than general market sentiment, but I don't think I'd want to be short going into a earnings report that may well show cash burn drastically reduced, and management maintaining 50k guidance.  Based on deliveries, Rivian Q/Q revenue is likely up \~50%.  If it was me, I wouldn't want to be holding a short position hoping it goes back down.
My 25 shares wish yours luck

Unfortunately for me I bought way back when at $130 sooooo ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260)
RIVN revived Today, and its time for it to climb back to $50-60 range
All eggs in same basket type of thing?
Bro this is regarded
Man jumped back in with jack
You know, I have been shitting all over RIVN and I still think it's trash but, damn, you made some serious cash on this. Also, fuck you.
Oh yeah? Well I'm down $8 today so must be nice![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260)
Is it still good for me to hop in?   New to it.
you spent 129K dollars to make 308 dollars! Now that's investing right there.
They are ugly but they are selling and on the road so.., calls
So late
RSI close to 80? I would not touch it. Good luck anyway
Do I really need to buy shit like this to get rich? Cause I’ll do it, but damn, fuck rivn
Are you really posting 0.24% gain porn? =
This is a YOLO! Fuck.
Surprised you went with rivian instead of fisker.
Saw a RIVN truck in Vermont the other week & almost bought in, but didn’t smh. How much room you think it has left? Maybe I’ll try and hop on the tendie express too
Wow nice yolo after it’s up 100% ahahahah
What’s your target price?
buying at the top . give OP award
Yikes
LFG need it to hit 500 a share.
Up 40% on my Rivian. To the moon!
RIVN🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀3X
🚗🤝
Nice plays, and fuck you
This is destined to fail but congrats on your balls.
Wow my guy bought after in ran up. Lol 😂 yolo bag holder

Brace yourselves, we're reaching interstellar levels of gains! To the moon, RIVN! 🚀
Not invested but I like the look of the cars! Good luck fellas!
I like the stock too.
To the moon and beyond, fellow rocketeers! 🚀🌕
You made 300$ on a 129k bet, why the fuck are you posting?
Anyone holding lcid?
Wanna talk about FOMO!?? I was in since the beginning. About $80 more per share and I might break even. As soon as I heard Amazon was getting Rivian trucks I dove in and didn't look back. >>>IDIOT<<<
bruh its more expensive than ford that should'a rung some alarm bells   RIVN is a dumpster fire homie, be sure to post your losses
Wow, that's some next-level YOLO-ing! 🚀
Puts on July 6th
How does op transfer so much money into robinhood? Are there fees involved?
Nice, I’m holding January 2024 $20 calls so I’ll be holding for a while, I sold my UPST calls for a 400% gain, they ended up at a 1700% gain….
Time to Sell some Calls and secure position lol . I will think of you every time I check price.
Exit liquidity comes from somewhere. In this case, from you  ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
I would really love to invest, but I don't know where to begin. Does any one have a map on how to start?
I salute you for you big balls, just be careful right there and make sure to have an exit strategy, the Feds meeting is closing in and the company is still burning hella cash, Tesla's price cut and Rivian refusal to cut prices is also a big factor in the next half
Im gonna grab some calls on Wednesday too. Looks appealing! And congrats OP.
🤕
I need this kind of money fuck congrats
🤣
Honestly, I laughed when I saw the boost to RIVN and then I decided to look at it and it’s actually a good company. They managed their revenue well at the beginning and are starting off with more cash then debt which is amazing. I’m bullish, it’s not a Tesla killer it’s a different type of vehicle that can compliment a Tesla if you happy to have enough money to own both.

I’ve got 500 @ $60 so I’m totally winning.
Ur welcome ![img](emote|t5_2th52|8882)
"PussyBreath007 initiates RIVN at Overweight and sets price target at $40."
Have a $15 July 21 call option that I think I am going to exercise. Had originally bought 4 of those calls and sold 2 when you 100% and then sold my 3rd when you 150%. Currently at 185% and think I like the stock potential more than just hodling or rolling the option.
Go fro bro 😎
I drive a Rivian and can assure you it’s not the best electric vehicle in the world. I like it but after a year it’s making a lot of noises a one year old car with 9k miles on it should not make. Also they still haven’t fixed warranty issues that were known about for over 9 months. I’m still a fan (actually have a pre order on a second one but not taking delivery till they get shit sorted out).  Anyway I’m pulling for them but they are far from perfect.  And for a normal family the ford lightning is a way better option.
Company that sells two different cars should be worth 37 billion dollars.  I'll have what you're smoking.

Damn the market is closed for me.
3 month high and up 15% today mmmmm I buy now
How do you sleep with that many calls?? I held 10 calls over the weekend and was scurred….
This could have just as easily wiped out your account.
Gonna print by Sep
See now this I can get with
Probably a reason why its where it is
So buy more
It is unlikely to remain at its current level for an extended period, and it's only a matter of time before it crashes back to $15. However, enjoy the squeeze while it lasts.
For the RH account, absolutely.
cool man to the moon!!!
Hey did you see that on after hour 🥹
Read comments ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
That 129k is mostly profits from previously held calls bought low and sold high. You got this OP. 25-30 incoming. My 19c’s believe !
Definitely not ugly
That they are on both statements. I’m seeing more and more where I live..not as many as Tesla but Rivian is gaining traction.
They look pretty cool at night
Why fuck Rivian?
Are you joking or really not reading post flair and commenting blindly?
RIVN 6600 shares at $19.55
Ticker is going to rip faces off.
Check out my other comments on this thread
Read the fucking flair you fucking donkey.
400% gain is nothing to complain about; that's fo sure
https://preview.redd.it/q136wn57is9b1.png?width=1170&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e1f8ccea12d8672de16fdb4ee95fd3d14d5426b1  Today
I rather a 17% gain off 10K than gambling 120K for a 0.24% gain. might as well leave that in a savings account.
lmfao
PB&J   A highly regarded sandwich / analyst combo
No vehicle is perfect and has problems. Tesla has many but doesn't mean it's not a good vehicle. Rivian trucks look kinda cool though.
I want one. i'm about to long F as well as they are the only contenders for the truck EV game   I part time with fabricators. Kinda thinking of creating an aftermarket product line for them.
https://preview.redd.it/8eygvkekis9b1.png?width=1170&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3f029a1095cd3f2c7cc1ec691fd14fc37c357ad0  Sell from this morning and buy back on shares today
It’s closed for all of us.
Helps that they expire in a month and a half, after earnings release. And they were mostly cheap.  I could cash out now going from 15k to 50k, but if it goes up a bit more the gains get exponentially better.  As a wise sage once said, "I like the stock"
All I need to see…  Total Return: 0.24% =
Mmm great timing buying at the top. Kinda late to the party?
Congrats and fuck you
Why would you not just exercise the calls and avoid the 50% tax?  Tf are you doing ????
It’s closed for all.
I had cleared 55k gains at open this morning after selling my calls/shares.  I found that selling my shares was a foolish move as this thing clearly has more room to run. Bought back in at this questionable cost basis.
I hadn’t planned on jumping back in.
Where are you pulling this 50% tax figure from?
And hold rivn for a year??? Gross
They don’t pay as well?
How would that save 50%? Both short term.
Your overall cost basis is what you initially started with.  Current cost basis is this last buy.
Hope you sold all to lock your $300 gains as it’s falling to $19.40 after hours.
FOMO is a helluva drug,  bro your supposed to hold while you pump the hopium, not drug yourself.
Dude you literally just threw away 40% of your gains. Clearly you just fomo  without actual research
Your moms ass
Ya it’s a beat down stock that has an easy chance of hitting 35 within the year
Ya holds
Hide and watch ! Rivian will continue to run up for the next 2 weeks at least. 25-30 IMO.
Eh fomo has gotten me this far lol.
Dude I literally ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)
Could you explain this to a regard
Sounds about right because it’s shit
Irs taxes short gains 10-40% depending on your income. If you work a normal ass job you probably gonna hit the 40% if you are homeless as you state then don’t worry about it
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Thanks, 75k a year means you’re paying 40% anyway? Why are people bothering OP, he probably has a job? What could he have saved?
It's nice to know my fellow regards never have to pay taxes on short gains.
Hold up - I thought it was 30%…. I recently won big and took some profits and left enough for the taxman in Rivian, Tesla, and Intel  shares… if I miscalculated by 10% then I need to save some of my work bonus in March for more taxes
You exercise the calls turning them into stocks. If you hold the stock for a year the gains you made on the calls are now long term investments. Less taxes.
I don't pay 40% and I made $120k last year
Short term capital gains are taxed as ordinary income. So whatever your tax rate is.
Lol umm check your tax bracket dumbass
So I’m confused about this. A little. I’ll use round numbers for an easy example.  I put my whole account of $1000 in ten SPY calls at $1.00.  I week later they are at $10.00 each. My account value is  now $10,000. Normally I would just sell and take the 900% gains and give ~30% to Uncle Sam at the end of the year.  What you’re suggesting is I exercise the calls instead and purchase 1,000 shares of SPY. Let’s say the strike price on those was $430. That would cost me $430,000 right? Even if I sold 9 contracts and exercised 1 of them I would still need $43,000 to buy the shares and the tax benefit would only apply to the one contract right? I’d still have to pay short term capital gains on the other nine, even if I found the other $34k to exercise the one call.  What am I missing or what do I have wrong in this scenario.
Nice! The call is worth less than 100 stocks so how does excercising work? Would money be taken from my account?
What is the tax on long turn investments?
Ty
Im gonna find some youtube videos and get educated/regarded
30% ? Depends on what tax bracket you are in. Could be 40%
If contracts are “in the money” then they are worth their cost in shares + time value of money.  You exercise the option contract when it’s in the money and turn your contract into 100 shares for a call.
Wtf did you just say. Did he get them from the 99? 99 calls but not one is for 100 contracts
This is so dumb I had to comment twice. Dude literally just google option trading tutorials
You're welcome. I'll grab you some Wendy's if you're hungry
Either way, what about the exercising part. I’m assuming this only works with enough capital that your options plays are only a few percent of your total account to begin with?
You have to be able to afford the 100 pieces of stock which make up a single contract.  He bought like 6000 shares after selling his contracts that’s like 60 contracts lol so he had the funds but decided to pay the tax man for the short term gains on the contracts then will pay taxes on any gains on the stocks. Not to mention the fees for selling and buying
Time to fire up the money printer.
Nipples Greg. Nipples.
Oct 2018 to March 2019 was about 20% increase, so I guess it predicted COVID?
So by your graph the recession is over?
But that chart only goes until 2015 i dont see a trend
The indicator works until it doesn’t.
This time actually is different. Demographic and wealth abnormalities are the cause for the deviation. Boomers still retiring at huge numbers. They also have the largest discretionary income. The labor pool will remain smaller than needed
Continuing claims have been [decreasing since April](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=16KtL) and had the lowest numbers ever recorded a year ago (your denominator) when [adjusted for population](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=16Ktb).
Wall street bets users are always right, they never lose money.
All indicators are flashing red…. But indicators are irrelevant when the printers are fired up there is only one possible direction to go and that is ⬆️.
I am thinking October when student debt repayment starts.   Then we will see if congress acts to relieve the debt.
This is the 8th 100% perfect recession indicator since Jan 2022 if only they came with a start date!
This is cute, but every time a dip shit posts “a recession happens when this target has been hit” is 0-790 right now.   Statistics says you have a better chance of getting butt banged by a dolphin in the Bahamas, then a bull shark biting your calf off, and then you finding a decent meal that has flavor in the Atlantis resort than this guy being correct.
Recession dez nutz
Alea iacta est
We had a hiring frenzy and record low unemployment levels. Going back to normal would result in something that looks like a massive unemployment trend.  I'm a bear too but I think the indicator isn't truly on yet.
This guy has been saying this since November ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)  [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/z37ohu/a\_recession\_is\_imminent\_heres\_what\_to\_expect\_from/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=ios\_app&utm\_name=ioscss&utm\_content=2&utm\_term=1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/z37ohu/a_recession_is_imminent_heres_what_to_expect_from/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1)
An increase in unemployment is one of the best things this economy can have if it wants to get inflation down to 2%. That is the best possible scenario to get labor wages down which will in turn bring COGS down along too. No matter how much you keep pushing down input cost, until labor cost come down you will not hit 2%, and until we see unemployment spike up, we will not see labor cost come down.
If you move the lines lower, they 100% perfectly predict economic activity. And if you move them above all the peaks they 100% predict the that all activity on the chart will be below the line.   If you calculate the median and put the line on the median it perfectly predicts the median.   If you took the line off the chart and shoved it up your ass you would have done something more impressive than this post.
Damn. With some people expecting July inflation to tick back up (August report). If that happens and if we actually get an explosion of unemployment… we’re fucked! ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)
How about instead of something useless like recessions you overlay it on the market?
According to your graph continued claims are negative and not near 20% so WTF are you talking about regard?
My only pushback is that savings are still high so it can cushion the blowback of unemployment for a bit longer than normally expected. Look at consumer spending instead. That’s still robust.
> Sometimes it is a lagging indicator (occurring in the middle of the recession), sometimes it is a leading indicator  Well if its a lagging indicator then you won't make any money anyway. Unless you know exactly whats going to happen its too risky
Percentage change, without considering the absolute employment level? Sounds reasonable. Typical brain-dead chart pattern tracking.
Continued Claims data only goes back as far as 1967, even though unemployment benefits have existed since the New Deal. That seems like something you would want to mention so as to not mislead people.
I love graphs because it doesnt mean anything😂
The fuck outta here with that logic bullshit.
I am excited at seeing all red soon. The Fed is purposely pumping up the market to then let it crash. They need to get rid of liquidity…crash the market and drain the retail investor.
Why don’t you try looking at the absolute numbers before you go and pretend this means anything?
62 upvotes after 5 hours. There is your answer. The recession scares no longer resonate with investors.
Did it work the last time there was an AI hype ?
This means we buy more calls?
Time to load up on more SPY calls
The recession was last year the leading indicators were adjusted. sorry yall missed the October fest buy in. Stop bitching and buy some damn stock already.  Not advice, I'm just saying if you still waiting on the DIP you are the DIP.
Quick question. Why are you not showing the most recent recessions, like 2020?
Yeah yeah, I’ll worry about that when I start losing trades, which ain’t happening now.

Interesting info. I haven’t bet bearish since my thesis was technically wrong and took forever to play out from late 21 to 22. Are you making any plays based on this?
Jokes on you Powell is gonna continue to raise rates a couple more times. Recession is on the way but let’s see what happens when the fed pivots
This looks very complex for me to understand. Based on this post, should I buy calls or puts two months out?
I think a recession is coming… but I also think that people assume recession means 2008 levels or COVID… um no… it will be mild compared to those two yes a dip, yes ours will hit but we don’t know when it will hit or how long it will last
This dude is trying to scoop your shares before they 🚀🌝
Stocks only go up, not even sure what all this means but stocks only go up!
I thought “continued claims” was when you say the recession is coming every month for 13 years then say “I told you so” when it finally happens.
https://preview.redd.it/uoouxcxo5y9b1.jpeg?width=1219&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1195bb403fef902538055aa3256da6a7cb3c45e4
Increased 20% from a historically low figure and still below 2 million. Meanwhile, GDP was upwardly revised, consumer sentiment is rising, and inflation is (slowly) returning to normal.   Will agree that new claims is ticking up and trending in the wrong direction but if you believe this is “recession imminent,” then your definition is such a minor recession then it’s unlikely to hit stocks.
Soft landing.
I'll leave this here  https://preview.redd.it/osaab57y50ab1.png?width=1793&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ffe58a2a6401845f0471328ba9087a6d7c8cfd57  white= initial jobless claims  dark blue = continuining jobless claims  apparently, the last part of the rally has started exactly when the continued jobless claims started the short decline  interesting fact: I checked manually the chart since 1968 and such decline has never happened after a +40% numbers, it's always a linear uptrend heading into a severe recession (kinda different for stagflation corrections)  small divergence between blue and white line is gonna be the key  here's a research paper about initial jobless claims as leading indicator  [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract\_id=2307705](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2307705)
I don't disagree. Why do you ignore the possibility that this is acting as a lagging indicator? We had our 2 consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth in 2022. The market peaked in 2021. 2 yr/10 yr has been negative since mid 2022 as well.   Not to be a permabull soft-landing fuck, but couldn't this be a lagging indicator that we are already in a mild recession by your own volition? I quote:   > Sometimes it is a lagging indicator (occurring in the middle of the recession)  I'm not trying to say you're wrong here. I'm genuinely interested in your take.

I think they're going to let this one ride for a little while. They've only fired up the printer during cases of low inflation, outside of the pandemic.
Money printer go brrrrr
I like how in the sequel, they found a way for him to breastfeed bringing this joke full circle
It was the taper tantrum.
There were quite a lot of indications that a recession was on the way leading into 2020, so yay economics for predicting Covid!
Toss in yield inversion and one could say it guaranteed a recession
Probably so, since Bill Gates did among a few other wealthy elites.
Haha
I chops off around 2015
Of course it's always possible every economic indicator misfires for the very first time simultaneously this time around. But I think its unlikely.  Remember we still have the negative yield curve. Real retail sales are down YoY. Credit conditionings are rapidly tightening. It's borderline textbook this time.
Like obscure baseball stats that sound amazingly impressive yet they are not.
Raw numbers aren't the indicator. Change in trend is the indicator. You'll only have a great backward looking indicator if you're looking at the raw numbers. If you really want to use the raw numbers, you could derive the exact same indicator from a moving average crossover.  And modest decreases also happened in recessions in the 70s and 80s.
The difference is if you spent all day all night in the ocean like you do markets, you'll eventually get your calves torn off by a bull shark and butt banged by a dolphin.  OP isnt saying it's tomorrow... but eventually.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|27189)
Trigger warning next time, *please.*
That's a pretty decent post, you should read it sometime.  >The key indicators to watch are for a **change in trend in unemployment (.3-.4% uptick NOT the nominal rate)**, and ***real retail sales yoy % change coming in at*** **-1%** or so. Those two things will indicate a recession roughly in the next 3 months. The above FRED links have recessions marked in gray. Check for yourself.  Unemployment is still holding out.
Unit labor costs going down = wages going down, correct? So then we’re in a world with prices staying propped up, just not increasing as much anymore, and wages down. I’m not being mean it just kinda seems like this is the way it goes anyways. Goal posts get shifted, the same job’s paycheck has way less buying power over time, more money funneled to big companies.

You mean like 1929 fucked?
Because market movements are random and anyone who thinks they can predict them is just an idiot gambler. #wsb  But really, the ability to forecast a market movement would mean you're ready to open up a multi billion dollar hedge fund. The ability to forecast a recession without knowing exactly how the market will react is doable by normal people.
Because reading the values along the X-axis is well beyond your abilities, Mr. Maximalist Regard. Also, what did I say the red line represents?
I think those who have savings it's because they had them forever. Poors ran out on money some time ago and are now living on credit card.  Maybe that's why LVMH has the largest market cap in Europe.
Consumers tore through pandemic savings at break neck speeds the last couple years. They now have around 50% less savings than they did pre pandemic. And that’s not accounting for inflation.  https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PSAVE
That's literally what the Fed does moron. Absolute levels are backwards looking indicators. Change in trends are forward looking.  [https://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/economic\_brief/2023/eb\_23-13](https://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/economic_brief/2023/eb_23-13)
Being quantitatively illiterate is so exhilarating! No numbers mean anything!
Don't think, just buy.
Also worth noting that the claim that a recession is imminent with a 20% increase in continued claims isn't exactly true... yes, a recession eventually comes, but there are numerous cases on that chart where it's years in the future and it suffers from the same problem other similar indicators do where the timing and conditions of the event aren't predictive and sometimes the events are things that are not considered to be direct result of the indicators, like COVID.  In real economics, you don't just use the oscillator, you add context like you're doing.   Honestly, when it comes to any complex human group endeavor, anytime someone finds something simple that seems to predict behavior, it should be a red flag, especially if the thesis is that something can't complicate it. Natural patterns don't work that way, human patterns definitely don't work that way.
Recessions aren't about absolute numbers, they're about comparing where we end up to where we've been. "Consecutive quarters of decline" have absolutely nothing to do with some fixed absolute numbers.  Comparing this May to where where we were last May is a really good indicator of trend, especially on a rolling basis for each month. And it removes seasonality bias.
Calls to the tits. December 500 SPY calls will not fail.
2020 fucks with the Y axis so the graph is only looking at pre 2020 recessions.
I think it would be Trump. Obama took over 2008 crash. Bush had dotcom and the beginning of GFC, what a 🤡.  This one will be Biden's. I think we are going to remember because a man that wore diapers had the worse crash since 1929.

2020.
No one here wants to hear anything other than bullishness because they’re all tits deep in calls.
Agreed.  Powell has pretty much said ‘u fcked’
Nope they will not let it ride. They literally already bailed out banks instantly. The finger is permanently on the print button even at the slightest sign of stress.
Thankfully we found the cure for recessions with zero consequences:    Massive money printing!
It’s “textbook” ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Yeah sure just ask the talking heads
Nothing about this economy is textbook, which is why all those indicators will fail.  For example your own made up indicator. In 2021 the yoy change in continuing claims was a whopping -82%, more than twice as much as any year since they began tracking it. The previous all time low was -37% in 1983. We also simultaneously hit a record all time low in unemployment rate.  Maybe, just maybe, you think this might have something to do with the extremely modest rebound in claims? 🤣
It will crash at some point, but people been screaming this for 3+ years.   I spend a lot of time in the ocean (look at my username), still no bite and not a victim of dolphin sexual aggression.
Yes. People need to be willing to work for less, but that will only happen if there is an excess supply of jobs available and the employers are in control of the market.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Dear god, I hope not that bad but… we’ll find out before the end of the year HOW fucked we are. Stay tuned :)
Poors don't matter though they don't affect eh economy much its the middle class if they stop spending then its a problem, what poors do nobody cares.
Morons like you would shut down entire states during covid on news that infection count had increased by 300% -- while the absolute count was 6 people total. The "change in trend" is the differential, and it has high volatility (means nothing) when base value is small.
Stop fear mongering
The rallying cry of  'Murica!
Puts
This is just something you made up. Recessions are about both absolute numbers and relative numbers.  Continuing claims is near all time lows and declining. % change means almost nothing at current levels. It’s as nonsensical as claiming the unemployment rate rose by 10%!!! If it went from 3% to 3.3%. Yea technically true but in reality meaningless and not a sign of anything wrong.  Looking at a single indicator alone with no context is the reason single indicators don’t work. Unemployment remains very low and the labor market remains very stable.  Considering your post history features you predicting an “imminent recession” over 200 days ago, I think you should probably stop trying to predict recessions.
Oh OK, I've heard that job reports recently have gotten a lot better from a white house press conference. Where can I find a graph like this one if I wanted to find out more?
I don't want to upvote you because of the beginning of the post, but the end is pretty convincing.
The market is gonna ignore things for a while and go up way more. AI is what's the market is pricing in. Unemployment rates won't matter with that as with AI it's gonna replace everything
On the contrary. Inverting WSB is a common investing philosophy, so as someone balls deep in calls, I relish the opportunity to hear negative sentiment posts.
Bailing the banks (depositors, not the investors) is a very different proposition from bailing the average pleb
They’re so stupid, people with a $200 Robinhood account think they can predict something with “economic indicators” reeeee
The graph also cuts off before 2020 to hide the highly irregular situation lol. This is some serious graph crime.
Based ocean bather  By your logic a recession is more likely than marine mamallian sexual aggression
U bathe in the ocean?
They matter when they strike or riot.
Imagine if poors stopped doing poorly paid jobs
LOL have some residual hatred for numbers people do you? You're just wrong.  What you said is true, if the sample size were 6. The sample size in this case is millions of people and its not very volatile at all.
That's the attitude.
You should start teaching your wisdom at the Fed, since they buy into this nonsense too. Maybe they'll be as smart as you one day. [https://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/economic\_brief/2023/eb\_23-13](https://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/economic_brief/2023/eb_23-13)  Also I clearly said it could be months away in that post and that unemployment was the indicator to watch for.
The graph does not show who was president. It's numerical. If you're interested in presidential history, I'd use wikipedia.
In other news our currency will be changed to chicken tendies.
Markets have been regarded for a while now. I'm expecting the pumping and the dumping to continue.  Also, investing in AI doesn't create as many jobs as practically any other investment, so the AI boom can keep pumping while the economy suffers from mild shrinkage.  But Intel is getting left out no matter what. No pumping, only dumping,,,,,,,, until the senators have finished buying Intel stock that is. Whenever the fuck that is.
Ever wonder if jobs are being replaced by AI in the first place...
They bail plebs daily with $1,200 in food stamps, $2500 in rental assistance, free utilities, transit, free healthcare, etc. how much more bailing can you get? Businesses even getting round 2 of ppp another 100k each bonus. Ah you mean stimmies… ya that’s coming right up the first second consumer spending slows.
The Fed uses similar indicators moron.
Them Orcas ain't playin' footsie.
It is a surfing reference when the ocean is flat. It is flat as a bathtub. Like my luck is it is always shitty conditions when I want to surf.
Only happens in a couple spots, no biggie. Remember occupy wallstreet? How much did that matter?
hard to imagine in USA because of a constant flow of immigrants that are willing to work under the table for fraction of the cost. My local home depot is full of people looking for work every morning they will gladly do those jobs
You literally just cited a paper that told you you need to use both a relative and absolute measure to accurately predict a recession. Neither of which are the measure you’re pretending matters here.  How much paste is in your diet?
Why is Intel getting left out?
Hate to break it to you but consumer spending has been slowing all throughout this yeae
Yeah, they bail plebs daily, that’s why r/povertyfinance looks so miserable
Don't try to argue with em dude it's pointless.  They can't understand basic indicators so they call they pointless.  Same people who think a trading plan is nonsense. They are just here to stir people up and gamble their 9 to 5 money on something else other them fantasy sports.

If we really wanted to curb border crossings we would execute the employers of undocumented labour.
>Conclusion:  We have argued that the year-over-year change in the unemployment rate or initial UI claims is a pretty good predictor (based on the AUROC criterion) for the start of a recession in the U.S. economy.  Since you didn't read it. Also continuing claims is either an exact or sometimes leading proxy for unemployment, which I mentioned.
Cause they design and fab.
That’s just a circle jerk
aint happening
Year over year, how much has the paste consumption in your diet changed?  > Conditional on the current unemployment readings, one can argue that a recession might well be imminent.  Since you stopped reading.  Weird that this needs to be pointed out again, neither of these things are continuing claims.
Have you noticed Florida?  The new anti-immigrant law offers threats of fines and prison. just imagine if they added the death penalty to it.
When you can learn to read better, you should go review that old post I made.  >The key indicators to watch are for a **change in trend in unemployment (.3-.4% uptick NOT the nominal rate)**, and ***real retail sales yoy % change coming in at*** **-1%** or so. Those two things will indicate a recession roughly in the next 3 months.  The unemployment uptick hasn't happened yet. That's when I said it would be **roughly a few months** before a recession.  Also since you're falling back to pedanticism, the intital claims graph cited in the paper shows the exact same thing. Initial claims, continuing claims, and unemployment are all tightly linked together. Here, look at the graph, since words seem beyond your means: [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/ICSA](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/ICSA)
Good thing we got 50 states then some of them are sanctuary states.
The old post where you predicted an imminent recession over 6 months ago? Yea I think I’ll pass on checking out you being an idiot, enough of that here.  The unemployment uptick you’re imagining will happen. Even though it absolutely won’t.  Got it.  I will bet you your account deletion that there is no recession by end of year.
Again, you didn't read my post. But at this point I don't believe you can read.
The post where you predict an imminent recession? That one?
How high on cocaine are you?
I didn’t read, I just know this is what happens when we are in a bull market.
TSLA mooning to $400 EOY confirmed
My DD that stonks only go up. AAPL calls it is
I don’t know but I have 4k puts on Nvidia and 4K on apple expiring this week simply cause F you… I’ll gladly prove you wrong at the end of the week
How to tell if someone privileged, "wages are high and everyone has money"   Dude, individual debt right now is high...foreclosures...high...repos getting higher...student loans around the corner.  If anyone has money...its old money...   National family income on avg is 75k...house prices are skyrocketing...  Nah.
The fuck did I just read?
Hard to read that being only semi regarded BUT I think what your trying to say is:  Bear market of 2022 wasn't a bear market, simply a minor pull back in a secular bull market that still has another 200-300% growth from here within the next 5-10 years as the current AI hype isn't a bubble but a new found focus on long term growth through technology and it is essentially the 2023 version of the internet coming to life or iPhone hitting the scene and that undoubtedly SPY/QQQ will continue on the once in a life time bull market that started from 2010 and will continually crush any long term bear as the US/World economy shrugs off the pandemic, money printing, inflation and any fear in the world as it marches higher to a P/E of 75 on it's quest to make everyone rich and that by throwing all your money into the market now is the best idea you could ever do because even though we have had the best first half of the year ever in QQQ, ATH will be reached quickly and continue on forever and ever AMEN.
Where do I start?  "Hedge funds haven't bought yet": so, your dumb money is smarter than their smart money.  "Inflation low as shit": double of target, but ok.  You chinese buddy probably is a spy working for xi jinping.
put down the pipe
time for puts!
Fuck man, he think everything is cheap seem son of a sheikh
The worst part about the last 6 months is fucktards like this made money
People buying expensive shit when every type of debt is at record highs is not the same as everyone having more money.  This is a melt up. We’re all splurging into a tail spiral 👍
AAPL $225 EOY
We go high, so high where no weed has taken us before.
I like how you’re illiterate
If this isn’t the single worst screed you’ve ever read in your entire life, then I’d like to know where you managed to find more useless drivel

Can someone make a video of Jpow rapping to this?
Everyone has money??? Savings and checking are at all time lows vs cost of living… debt is insanely high
At this point, the trick is to determine how many inverses are you gonna apply to what you read on WSB.  No one can convince me that Jim Cramer does not have genuine active fans in this community

This “DD” made my head hurt
This is great regardation

Sir, AAPL and FB had yoy declining revenues.
Can some explains what the QQQ is made of? Is it like the snp 500? I need some info. Please anything. I do belive exactly what this guy is saying tho. I see Tesla at 10 trillion market cap in 10-20 years. Bear case. Bull case? Who knows. Tech only goes up. Tech is the only thing changing the world right now. So I see it. I wish I had more funds.

Few similar methy rants from this robot a week lately.
Or maybe he already has puts on every ticker he listed, and he posted here so people can tear down his post and actually get an indirect confirmation for his puts.   So maybe the actual play here is buying calls for everything he listed.
Hot damn, I can't wait for this movie already!
That's exactly what I wanted to hear.
That is true. Maybe he tried snorting Total War because he couldn’t afford the cocaine?
I’ll sell the moment JPOW says he’s going to lower rates. Until then, we ride at dawn.
Yup, mid August+
Nah. We pull back after holiday rally as is the norm.

In my defence, i was drinking whiskey.
Buy every dip, no matter how small or large.
My 275 July Calls hit margin call last week and i am devastated
Buy August call and hold them until IV runs up towards earnings. Jump out before actual earnings. Made so much money doing this. Its crazy how easy it is.
Bagholders post wave incoming (all the upvotes make me one go bearish)
RIVN ON TOP
 Bears are real quiet today
they still have 3x the margins of any other legacy car company.
Not touching it with Cathy Wood's dick long or short. Inventory build + having to slash prices is not 50% yoy growth + being the only car company on the planet.

What a great open for TSLA calls my god.
Tesla deliveries? Buckle up, we're going to Mars!
\+158% YTD  Welp TSLA bulls were right
Yep lots of upper middle class white dudes are ready and willing. Was a smart move to lower prices too, you already have the name recognition and margins are very healthy so it’s a great long term play.
Fire extinguisher included?
Elon, please deliver my pizza next time! 🍕😂
*laughs in China’s -80% y/y auto sales
That was the look on my face opening another short position this morning..... Love that the simps pushed the stock up today.  Hope it goes up more before the 19th as well.
Elon, please deliver my pizzas too! 🍕🚀
TSLA puts printed today. Thank you.
🌈 🐻 nuts are waiting to get chomp by bulls 🐮
Delivering on a dino juice truck. ironic
Oof
Hey I bought one of them, maybe yours.  It was up decent enough last week, then red.  Monday went back into green, then red but I held.  Shoulda sold last week honestly, but we'll see what happens the rest of the week.  I'm looking to exit Wed if it can get green.
Positions? I need some picture confirmation before jumping in
I’m going to put the ribaculator in the 3/4 position and hold x5.
Assuming there’s not a pullback before earnings.
Wait for the margins to be shown at earnings and a share offering
[deleted]
And when you ride in one it shows.  Feels like the land version of the Titan submersible.
No they don’t. They are higher than most (Ferrari still higher though) but no where close to 3x
Ha thanks I should have posted it  ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641)
I just laugh everytime "TSLA IS OVER EVALUATED" cringe people keep spaming it and then TSLA stock keeps rising.

Wait for Texas and Berlin giga factories to start pumping out profit. They have yet to become profitable at their scale, which brings down the profit per vehicle number.
They were going to sell more anyway. Margins will still be 16-18 percent range industry leading. Keep on smoking that copium.
I actually drive one and statements like this confuse me because I really like the car. It’s very comfortable, looks nice and clean, and it’s great for road trips and commuting.   Just did a nice little family day trip hitting up a few parks and viewpoints, taking the ferry, driving around.   It’s really nice to just have the big screen to see points of interest nearby. Stopped at a few beaches I’ve never been to.   It’s nice to have the entire route planned on the screen in front of me. It’s nice getting out at a stop, exploring around, cooling it back down as we decide we’re ready to move on. Just get in the car, wait for everything to buckle their seatbelts and I’m already driving to the next location with an air conditioned car and navigation already setup.   It’s nice having lots of space to bring out the coolers and the grill to stop and make some lunch at a random park.  My Model Y has been a massive improvement over the Tacoma I had before that, and I thought the Tacoma would be the fun truck to drive around and have those kind of day trips with.  It’s always so weird when people shit on the car I drive all the time while I’m perfectly happy driving it. Clearly there is some subjective opinions being thrown around as if they’re a matter of fact.
wtf.... do you just make this things up?
Agreed. I feel disappointed still that the competition is so weak though, Tesla hits price, speed, range, technology inside, charging stations etc. it’s well short of having good build quality but they’re vertically integrated unlike all other car brands. I hate Elon and he’s not even the driving force behind Tesla, the shine is really starting to peal off their cars like cheap chrome.
Fr
😊🤣😂😆 this made an amazing visual!
As a Tesla owner I still appreciate this sick burn
legacy I.e Ford, GM, Toyota, Honda, Kia etc.  you're thinking luxury/super car brands, which yes have a way higher margin but they aren't delivering hundreds of thousands of cars a qtr
That’s quite optimistic but I’ll jump in after a dip
They shit on it because they had puts. I'm with you..it's a nice car. Solid and well built in my opinion. Is it perfect, no but it's a higher tier vehicle.
Feel the same way. Still love my Model 3 after 5 years. Sure it’s minimalist but it is a phenomenal driver’s car. Never feel like anything is “lacking” personally.
Now I want to hear your opinion of Elon
Same. Don’t worry, the person who posted it and all the people upvoting probably have never sat in a Tesla, never mind driven or own one.  It’s a great car. Not perfect but better than any other car I’ve driven (especially for its price).  I’ve had people shit on my car after mentioning what I drive and they completely change their mind after 1 passenger seat ride. It’s hilarious, but the cars really do sell themselves.
> It’s nice getting out at a stop, exploring around, cooling it back down as we decide we’re ready to move on. Just get in the car, wait for everything to buckle their seatbelts and I’m already driving to the next location with an air conditioned car and navigation already setup.  You can't do that with gas/diesel?  LMAO
Its actually a rather reserved move. I will hold it until close to earnings and collect on the on the rising IV
Nobody is going to say any car is perfect. Nobody can tell me they own a perfect car because nothing is perfect. Imperfections don’t bother me because I’m not going to pretend everything has to be perfect in order for me to enjoy something.  It’s just insane to me that everyone lets their emotions get the better of them.  I didn’t buy a Tesla because of Elon and I never think about Elon; except for all the times that people bring him up. Weirdos letting some asshole live in their minds rent free.
I prefer some gas hogging cars, just cause some of them are cool. Etc ORVs and performance sports vehicles
I’m perfectly fine acknowledging that Tesla’s against another vehicle of the same price point have worse qualities. But fuck me, I’ve never been in super fancy BMW to actually know the difference. Maybe I just don’t have the perspective to know what I am missing out on. But, I guess I should just remain ignorant because I’m happy and why would I want to fuck with that?
He’s a fucking asshole and a lucky idiot.
he bring me endless entertainment from talking about free Speech then bought Twitter 'cause he tho he going to get sue then the beef with the Lizard king.
I test drove my friend's Model 3 when shopping for an EV.  The seat wasn't terribly comfortable, the door felt cheap and overall the car had an overall lack of sturdiness to it.  It felt like my 2013 Hyundai in terms of build quality.  By all means not a bad car, but at the price point it was at compared to the Hyundai I'd expect a much better quality car overall.  Wind noise was very high too compared to other well built cars in the same price point.  You can argue it's more competitive now at the cheaper price point, but given their margins you're still overpaying for a subpar quality vehicle when compared to other companies.  Just my .02.  I ended up going with a Kia EV6 because that thing feel almost as good as my girlfriend's Audi.  It just feels like a tank and there's almost no outside noise that bleeds through.  Tesla is superior with the tech and charging infrastructure, though.
Ok, I’ll roll my 7/14 280s this week
Happens a lot these days.
So you bought a tesla so you could benefit from the exploitation of minors/poors/minorities who harvest the precious lithium inhumane working conditions?  All for the false sense of 'going green'?
I think the seats and ceiling trim/fabric are the most obvious shortcomings from a first impression standpoint. They mesh perfectly fine with the minimalist aesthetic, and they’re not deal breakers for many, but anyone familiar with more premium, leather seats can spot it. They almost appear pressformed, rather than bolstered and stitched.
Does rolling it actually have any real benefit?  What if you in the green on the 280's and you just sell and profit.  Then buy the aug calls.  Would that way be more profitable than rolling?
That’s a lot of fancy words. I just like the white seats so it’s not scolding hot after sitting in the sun and the seats are comfortable for me. I wish the Model Y had ventilated seats because that’s an upgrade I care about. The material, I don’t care that much about. I don’t spend a lot of time sitting in my car naked, so I’ll just stick to buying cloths with materials I find comfortable.
Im going to do what you are saying. I used the word “rolling” incorrectly. (I’ve only done naked calls for a month, so a lot of terms are new to me.)  I used “rolling” as a term meaning I’ll place calls twice, not necessary in a row as that would be selling high and buying higher.
Comfort is more than materials. Where and how much padding and bolster is applied can create a mixed range of comfort and resistance to g-force.
I understand what you’re saying.   Do you understand what I am saying though? Because, I said I find the car comfortable. You’re telling me it can be more comfortable which, sure. I believe you. But what am I suppose to do with this information? Should I be be uncomfortable now because it’s not as as comfortable as it could be?
You said earlier you didn’t get where the quality critiques came from and I’m explaining the main points of those opinions.   I already understand that some people don’t care and said the decision plays well into the cabin design. You can be fine with it and notice it exists.
I think you can look at the original comment I replied to and see that I’m not disagreeing with what you’re saying. I’m talking about poor hyperbole or just straight up objectively wrong statements.  There is just a difference when speaking about something subjectively and objectively.
Like your gf.wont give you something you like , you just need to get things done in an more expensive way
Oh yisssss China trade war 10.0 ![img](emote|t5_2th52|18632)
The metals aren’t particularly rare or difficult to find, both metals are byproducts from processing other commodities such as coal and bauxite. Why bother reading about export licensing proposals for unrefined gallium/germanium exports when you can just proclaim that semiconductors will take a hit?
Ahhh so market makers pushing for people to load up on puts now so that they can keep the stock elevated or even pump it some more. Not falling for it.  NEXT.
Inb4 new 500B nation security of strategic minerals/rare earth metal protection bill introduced at the floor of congress. 70% goes to Intel/IBM/Apple/Microsoft/Broadcom/Qualcom and 29% goes to politicians ~~pet~~ constructive projects and 1% goes to actual mineral/rare earth mining (all of that 1% goes to pay for the bureaucratic legal paperwork system). Then they'll cry not enough and provide an additional 500B bill. See it's not a 1T bill it's absolutely fiscally responsible ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
What's stopping western producers from stepping up to fill the void soon? Sure it maybe more expensive to manufacture/start ramping up production in western countries.   Does china really want the US and other semiconductor manufacturers to stop relying on it especially when it comes to these 2 metals?
Here’s some related info:  https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-gallium.pdf
Demand for chips isn't going anywhere.  They'll just hike prices to deal with the increased cost of goods
I mean just use another material to make it then
My background as microelectronic engineer shows the totally fake "breaking news" from today. Chip making materials are "normally" distributed on the earth, not like diamond mines as the public suppose. The Chinese government is playing muscle game, but without real power, like Russians in Ukraine. Rare metals are actually not rare - just visit Wikipedia and the Natural History Museum in London (see mineral part of the exhibition). Good reason to buy chipmaker, for a short game.
In the blue corner…you have the freedom loving…war mongering...USofA  In the red corner…you have the ruthless…oppressive…scary dragon…China   iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiitttttttttttttt’sssssss =   TIIIIIIIIIIIIIIMMMMMMMMEEEE! =
The six critical metals found/produced in Canada: copper; indium; selenium; tellurium; gallium; silver.  You're welcome
OP belongs here, considering the alternative sources available and the massive threat to China's monopoly found earlier this year  https://finance.yahoo.com/news/16-largest-silicon-producers-world-212541541.html  https://www.dw.com/en/sweden-discovers-europes-largest-known-rare-earths-deposit/a-64365661
So less money for China no problem
Wouldn't this work in the opposite way? If there's a shortage they can charge more making the stock go up.
Why does this post repeat so much? You got dementia and forgot you type stuff? I’m regarded as fuck and you keep making me read things I already read fuck you OP
Welp. So long Chy-na bois!
Carbon Radium Phosphorous  makes what …?
https://archive.is/DmVT1
I don’t think AI is going to like this.
You just need a hand.
Building a new mine in a country like Australia takes time. So this bearish. I don’t think the problem will be for chip makers. It will be for things like car batteries that use these metals. With a chip the metal is not what you are paying for.  All the same I wish China and the USA could show each other respect and stop this.  But, China sees this as a “battle” they must “win”! Look at the title “hits back”  You dont win a trade war at best lose less than the other guy.   Who is getting hurt less the “west” with inflation or China with it obviously hiding its growth numbers. Whatever Chinas actual numbers are it is not the 7%  gdp gains it had for 40 the freaking years China was a friend of the “west”
wrong.   https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-gallium.pdf
Are you regarded?
It’s important to approach market dynamics with a critical eye. While market makers have a role in trading, it’s not realistic to think they have control over what China does. Stock prices are influenced by many factors, it’s incorrect to assume market makers are deliberately pushing people to buy put options just to manipulate prices in response to China’s actions.
You are thinking too small. MMs have likely cornered the physical market for gallium and germanium already.
Its not that us cannot produce gallium or germanium..they are not even particularly rare but dependency on china is by design…first of all us mining companies cannot compete with chinese companies mainly because of low skilled labor cost difference. Secondly mining creates all kind of environmental issues and pollution..every country has limited resources..ask yourself, would you rather want your country to have low skilled laborous mining jobs or high skilled white collar semiconductor and tech jobs?
Supply chain hasn’t been restructured yet. US has deposits of these minerals but hasn’t setup operations to mine it on a large scale, that takes time. Russia and Ukraine are the next big sources next to China but good luck with that. This is really happening, it isn’t fud to manipulate the market and tech is going to get hit hard by it, not just NVDA
they can’t “step up and fill the void”  Domestic primary gallium production in the United States has not occurred since 1987. However, gallium is imported into the United States for consumption.  China has the entire market:  https://preview.redd.it/0his7l4eou9b1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=01a6ec1b8adb8bba4a04380e69fb4c5cecf1f45c
China： You force me do that.
> What's stopping western producers from stepping up to fill the void soon?  lack of demand. As long as it is not a problem to buy GaN charger from china, nobody would buy more expensive Ga to make more expensive chargers
Am i regarded or does that article says china produces 98% of the gallium in the world and us produces almost none? If true, holyfuck.
You express your opinion, your statement is not accurate. It is true that chipmaking materials are distributed globally, the control over production and supply chains can have significant implications. China’s dominance in the production of certain metals used in chipmaking, such as gallium and germanium, can impact global supply and pricing (exacerbating inflation). Additionally, the geopolitical dynamics surrounding trade restrictions and export controls can affect the availability of these materials.
China has the entire market.  https://preview.redd.it/v8gpaaxxbu9b1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8af41269de1fac88f5d66c94af27ac77203894fb
from your own article  https://preview.redd.it/zyoatfjp5v9b1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=58c569db532467833411ad00e84c619b78ad5975
So according to this [article](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-03/china-to-restrict-exports-of-metals-critical-to-chip-production) this will end up with higher prices but allow others to fill the gap ending China's dominance of the market on them.  “When they stop suppressing the price, it suddenly becomes more viable to extract these metals in the West, then China again has an own-goal,” said Christopher Ecclestone, principle at Hallgarten & Co. “For a short while they get a higher price, but then China’s market dominance gets lost - the same thing has happened before in other things like antimony, tungsten and rare earths.”

Are you trying to say this is not a conspiracy to get me to sell my Tupperware shares for cheap? ![img](emote|t5_2th52|12787)
Just took me regard glasses off and… your response look ai 😂🤦‍♂️
I know its not fud to manipulate I think this announcement will give enough time for the US to stock up on the materials needed and give a headstart to ramp up production.  with all the manufacturing Biden is focused on he could simply start giving out incentives again just like the chips bill.
Well, in a way that's true. It was a retaliatory measure.
98.2%!  Russia is 0.9%.  Meaning 99.1% achievement unlocked!

Yes, it is not a black/white case, China has real advantages in some areas, I remember the story of the opium wars, some 200 years ago
They're still selling, just not to restricted countries. Think this through, what do you think happens. Think about Russian oil.
You think mines are built in a day? China is wrecked by 2025
China owns the entire market.  https://preview.redd.it/6btrxl7gnv9b1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7daa25aa01239e82af799bd6a7f26098a75c723c
Reads about the same as Visual Mod’s responses.
And Ukraine is the third largest producer at like 0.5%and produces it in Russian controlled regions ☠️
China doesn’t need new mines. They are the worlds largest producer and also have the worlds largest production capacity of raw materials used in semiconductors.  https://preview.redd.it/8lc2e2b56v9b1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7fc4016beaf6c82c951c71efe771770b7931bb07
Did you read my comment? They won’t “own” the market for much longer.  https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-03/china-to-restrict-exports-of-metals-critical-to-chip-production
This could get messy.
Your dumb as hell bruh, but good luck on your 'endeavors'
This stock is priced for perfect conditions. This is a setback and needs to be evaluated. It’s a cyclical stock in a slowing economy, etc etc etc   add to that this and the US and Europe recent restrictions.
Why did it take the Chinese and Russians so long to use this?
Did you finally figure out the purpose of this war? Lol
okay “bruh”
The Chinese have weaponized their dominance not just in rare earths supply chain but in others as well, for example a Senkaku Islands dispute in 2010 where they restricted rare earths to Japan, for some really asinine and emotional reasons restricting all sorts of trade between them and Australia, Lithuania and various others in recent years, and between them and the US on solar cells about ten years ago which is ongoing and which the WTO ruled in favor of the US on last year.  There are a lot of other examples where the Chinese have done this. The problem is that it is producing results that are unfavorable to the Chinese in every single one of these examples. In 2010, Japan imported 82% of its rare earth materials from China. This dependence was reduced to 58% in 2019, with the target of less than 50% in 2025. Right now, the US imports 80% of its rare earths from China, but in 5 years it will be less and in 10 years dramatically less because the US is opening its mines back up. Up until 1985, the US was the largest producer of rare earths. Those have since closed down due to the convenience of getting them from China but all of that is changing rapidly. Legislation is being passed that will restrict Chinese rare earths from government and military production.  What Chinese have not realized is that weaponizing their dominance in certain sectors makes people want to stop dealing with Chinese anymore in those sectors. In the solar cell example, Chinese were using their access to cheap and readily mined coal without any regard for the environment to drive down costs on those cells and then dumping the market, putting many producers globally out of business. All in a loud and clear eff you to the WTO which had bent over backwards to shoehorn them in. What producers started doing in response is making low carbon solar cells to make them easier to make and with the help of governments (US and EU) passing laws requiring lower carbon cells, as well as tariffs on Chinese cells, which the WTO agreed with.  The Chinese seem to be under the mistaken impression that there are no consequences to this sort of behavior. Decoupling is happening and US investment in China is tapering off. You can add security concerns and the desire to be in a stronger position in relation to China when they attack their neighbors, engage in massive scale human rights abuses and collude with others engaged in war crimes to the list of other reasons.  Finally, the US is currently building stockpiles of rare earths to fill in until the mines come back online.
> This stock is priced for perfect conditions.  The stock is priced according to the principles of the market efficiency theory. The price is perfect with all available information currently known to the market.
Because China mainland doesn’t make most of the GaAs/GaN silicon wafers (they do make some though).  Will they sanction Taiwan?  🤷  Probably not.  So on the surface it’s kind of symbolic, but the potential for unintended consequences is particularly high with control of 99.6% of current supply.
Short NVDA some more then, I'll pour one out for you when the FEDs pump it during their next "QT" phase.  Or was it "QE"? Fuck if I know, and they don't either
At that time, Japan sued China at the WTO, which led to China's relaxation of restrictions.  But now the WTO mechanism has been destroyed by the United States, and the alliance formed by the United States has imposed various trade restrictions on China,  The WTO arbitration mechanism is now defunct.
US starts weaponize industry first
The US has 0 reserves
When do you believe the US first started?
According to the US Geological Survey, it does.  https://www.usgs.gov/news/technical-announcement/usgs-updates-mineral-database-gallium-deposits-united-states  https://www.usgs.gov/data/germanium-deposits-united-states
Can't all kind of measures taken by the US to directly harm Chinese semiconductors industry lately be taken as weaponising?
Having 2 places that you can start mining it is not the same as having a stockpile of it in ready-to-use form, unfortunately.
If you have been following Apple in last decade, this is nothing new.   Unveils a hyped product- Stonks go up a lot.  Leaks the bad news early - Stocks go down just a little bit. Analysts lower expectations.  Delivers outperformance- Stonks skyrockets.   This has been their theme for last decade. Nothing new here.
Meh, I remember similar doom and gloom articles about the iPhone when it first came out.
Did they cut it from 100 to 50?
  Never wanted a headset, why do companies keep making them? It will go the way of the 3D television: high price, nobody asked for it, production stops once they learn this finally
Who cares, 4 trillion next baby
Hmm, I guess their reports are in, and the results are... nobody will buy one.
Ah yes, the ever reliable “supply chain report” for a 2024 product without a release date. Pass.
Hearsay
Apple to 240
I'll say this again and again  no one wants to put any stuff over their face  I think the sunglasses, welding shield, and eye protection goggle is the only thing people are willing to wear. Even eye protection, some will go lengths to not wear one and just get by with a safety squint.
How is Apple Vision pro any different than the Meta Oculus headsets?   As an aside, what's the point of having an Apple watch?
What if I don’t want to eat ass and short it
This is copium for flopped unveiling
Do they play music and help you calculate tips? That would make it worth buying.
Another source: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-03/apple-sharply-cuts-vision-pro-headset-production-target-ft-says](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-03/apple-sharply-cuts-vision-pro-headset-production-target-ft-says)     Hopefully they won't increase the price even more.
This is probably one of the dumbest ideas for product ventures in the modern day.  There are no consumer practical uses, commercial applications is very niche, other companies have tried and failed or are burning a lot of cash in its pursuit.   It’s like look at all these companies that have failed miserably let’s get a piece of the failure pie…fucking duh.
If a girl wears something like this on her ass then sit on my face thats the only time I am going to use VR. Nobody likes to wear stupid looking devices on their head.
VR/AR is still a niche as hell market after 10 years of development and selling to consumers. Quest 2 came close to finally moving that adoption needle to mass market but it dropped the ball in terms of attractive VR games (most people I know who own the quest has it sitting in a closet gathering dust)   If Apple thinks it can pull another iPhone like revolution like it did in the smartphone space 20 years ago then it has another thing coming.
Why do people insist on wearing expensive goggles? AR is overrated.
I wouldn’t mind a VR set just for videogames but not for $3500. Even the PSVR2 is a hard sell at $550. But to make matters worse, Apple expects you to keep this shit on all day…or until the battery runs out, which only lasts 2 hours apparently lmao. Can’t even watch a full movie on that
do anyone one here know any who knows anyone who actually uses one? I loved minority report, but waiving my arms around all day to use excel sounds like pain on top of boredom on top of stupid. This is like 5K 3D wraparound TV. But here the 5K is for cost...
Shocking that they didn’t realize that no one would want this until the price was reduced by 250%
You mean their years late VR aren’t flying off the shelf for the price of only $7,000?  I am astounded!
Dead on arrival
Apple to 0
Artificial scarcity means more sales. More sales means more lambos.
Where’s that charging mat?
Yeah they dropped the ball on this one.
Guess Apple's vision of a headset just lost its 'Pro' status! 😂
Guess I'll have to settle for a pineapple strapped to my face then 😂🍍
I’ll wait until the Apple Vision Pro can interface with all devices in the Apple ecosystem. If I have an iPhone, the headset should allow you to visualize the phone’s display in your headset similar to how it’ll handle MacBook displays.
Literally priced in. ETF flows all that matters for tim apple. This is non news
Short it !!!
Ouch
This is just FUD news to protect themselves after the stock has run up so nicely in the last 30 days
I still don't see a reason why anyone would buy Vision Pro for 3500, and a damn charger that comes for 700.
The only thing that scares me about Apple is I learned from here to not bet against them.
Also says in there the high price was because they didn’t expect to sell many. They consider 100k to 150k as not much. Curious on who will buy. I often find a headset to be too clunky and to require too much.
as long as they sell the 8k cheese grater, fine by me ![img](emote|t5_2th52|8883)
Sound like a bullish sign for AAPL another 30% up side from here
Looks like Apple's vision for the headset got a little blurry! 😂
This will take off when real reality is inescapably boring than AR/VR world. That threshold hasn’t happened yet. But we do see people spending more time in phone reality than real world, so its possible but we are not there yet. If it does happen, world will just become more dystopian.
is this what caused the red today? lmao
but “it’s the future” and “everyone will be living in the meta verse”… haha  people are so predictable!
$3500 is excessive for a 1 gen product
Who would have thought there would be problems for a headset 80% of the population can't afford and the ones who can...well they know this is bad for society as a whole.
Give it 5 more years.  Apple going to be 🐉🐉🐉
People that buy apple products are... stupid and looove getting played. Clearly.
BUY THE DIP
Going to save them money when they realize no one wants to pay $3,500 for a be headset
3GS. Yeah let’s make some cut backs.
Promise the sky, make cuts to plans, analysts downgrade, company outperforms, stock rockets. Rinse and repeat.
Puts on Unity then
VR is where tech companies go to die. It will always be a gimmick
It’s to big, I can’t imagine to wear that for whole day :/
Not sure the first two apply here. I was eyeballing the stock during the announcement and it barely moved. Doubt this news will do anything either.
Apple has zero stake in the Apple hype cycle except for "product available sometime in early 2024".  An analyst invents a number for units produced, a market value and a market share. Then you'll see a lot of articles on this, mostly with a negative spin.  Later: Analyst claim Apple can't reach the number he invented.  Even later: Apple launches product.  A few years back you would then get the "it sucks and an imaginary Samsung phone will kill it next year" add on freebie but it seems Apple really has cornered the market for all wearables so dreaming up competition became a bit long in the tooth and the Vision is just too far ahead for anyone to believe it anyway.  It's been like this since forever. It has zero impact on stock value.
Give the Vision Pro 3-4 years to become an established category.  iPhone, iPad, Watch were all heavy, had clunky UI, little battery life and did very little for their 1st year release. They were very expensive compared to anything else, but then after 3-4 years they became refined enough that they now sell like hot cakes.  Give the Apple Vision 3-4 years to see if it establishes itself as a good product category. All their other categories are going to be their cash cows and those sales will impact stock price more than this Vision Pro.
lol how many shares are you holding  but this is just a hyped product. Apple's real business is in the phones and the ecosystem that comes with it to ~~trap~~ provide the consumer with a seamless experience. So it doesn't matter what the news on the $3500 headset is for now.
Its more like apple announces overpriced product nobody wants to buy stocks go down next quarter the numbers show people actually buy them numbers go up
What was the early, leaked, bad news for the last two iphones?
kk
![img](emote|t5_2th52|18630)
How much did you buy last week?
Unveils a hyped product on June 5th - stock plummeted that day. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|18632)
I know most WSB r3tards can't read balance sheets but good lord ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640)
So hit buy button every dip from now until end of Q3?
Sooo calls?
I remember Google glass
Yeah but people actually wanted the iPhone
I reminds me of their smart speaker not the iphone, the only thing that apple did wrong with the iPhone was not making it 3g which they fixed later on
Is the iPhone still around?
Yes, if you multiply both those numbers by 10,000.
Apple are big enough and have enough of a cult following that they assume they can create new demand, rather than just meet existing
Calls on Apple
$3500 for un established tech  Its Apple, however, I expect high quality
People will be waiting on lines for this like an iphone and scalping it for 5 grand guaranteed
Depending on how well the ppd looks and matches or exceeds 64 ppd I'd be interested in it as an end all be all theater experience.
I’m not rich, I’m buying one. Love AR, just been holding out for a quality experience.
They will be sold out for the first 3-6 months if you think otherwise throw a wager out
As a face-sitting aficionado, I respectfully disagree with your assessment.
I dug a piece of aluminum out of my tear duct area last week because I'm regarded and often safety squint instead of using the safety glasses sitting on my head
What I’ve heard from the tech demo was promising, especially about the weight, feel, eye-strain, etc. Predictably, people are saying it’s the best AR/VR device they’ve demoed; granted each and every one of those people (thus far) are a walking California stereotype.
Idk I have 3 monitors in my work from home setup. If I could replace all that space with some goggles, and have the equivalent of all my monitors for working outside of the house it’d be pretty damn nice
I don't understand exactly what do you do with it? Watch tv? Like I can do without that thing on my head... if there was a killer feature maybe, ok still not at that price, but I really can't see a good or better a necessary use of it. Is there any?
And you won't know if your roommate's girlfriend accidentally walks in on you while you're on Pornhub VR. Situational awareness, folks!  And then there were the parades of diesel duallies protesting wearing things that saved people's lives....
Metas headset is VR.  Apples is AR  Apple Watch primarily has been focusing on its medical side using bio feedback provided from the watch.
1. It's using the same chip as iphone/macbooks making it able to run basically everything either of those can directly on the device. 2. It's Apple. They have the ability to shift market by just being Apple as well as shift developers. 3. The screen is bespoke. There is nothing as good as it on the market.  I'm still not totally sold on it but if anyone can pull this off, it is apple.
Huge differences, watch their reveal video. Saying this as a Meta Quest 2 owner
Apple watch is actually pretty cool. Can read texts, track health stuff like fitness and heart rate, make calls or decline them and ofc read the time and shit.
Honestly I just use the Apple Watch for running. If you get it with data, you don’t need to bring your phone, you can listen to music and track your heart rate and your route. I take it off right after cause it’s kinda redundant to the phone, but I guess people like having a watch on their wrist too.
Not much:   \- much better resolution  \- Totally insane price  \- Better hope for steam VR compatibility if you want to play anything, but do not expect it to look good, since better resolution is nothing if the game is running 720p with textures to size. And I'm not sure devs are going to throw self all over the new headset when it can't be mass adopted (back to price)
Status symbol
It’s an actual ar workstation where as meta is just second life
If you watch the Meta Quest Pro announcement video vs the Apple Vision Pro, the selling points/use cases are really similar.  The real difference is just the price of the components. Apple has better screens, cameras, processors, etc. Apple also has the brand/marketing power.
One of the huge differenciating factors would be how apple will be able to extends on its current ecosystem. Occulus at this point is a geek gadget, its not appealing enough to the general audience. Apple VR extends on whats familiar and it doesn’t scare away people, rather generates genuine curiosity.
Wouldn't that be considered "BR"?
This isn’t for video games. They announced this at a developer conference not a gaming one. They want devs to buy this. If you think it’s too expensive it’s not you who they even want to buy it lol
I’d cum
It does, but you have to look at longer time frame. Reason is "buy the rumor, sell the news", so stock goes up long before announcement, but is directly related to announcement
Where has it gone post announcement?
It’s went up like 10ish bucks since the announcement, not crazy but I get it, I got burned on calls during the announcement too.
there is absolutely no movement from a Brand New product, they havent introduced something like this in years. the entire market is a sham held up by the federal reserve and its 23 direct market makers. those goggles are gonna be dope and everyfuckingone is gonna buy them.
I mean, maybe coincidental timing, but they announced the headset and hit a new ATH within two weeks.
Gotta admit… It’s better than Tesla’s sometime in Early 2024!
I think Apple is trying to compete with HoloLens at the price point they put it at. The basic HoloLens 2 is $3500.
Give me a freakin iPod with SSD, Bluetooth, and scroll wheel and I’ll give them another $1k
Apple's real business is keep us addicted to their products and the product status. We're all iJunkies and they're our only supplier.
k
These are gonna be sold out for at least 3 months
Show me someone who says they don’t want these and I’ll show you a liar….
A lot of people want the vision pro, my friends are on the train already and I didn’t have to even talk about it to them… it aims to solve a lot differently but it’s not there yet
The speaker is a good speaker, what sucks about it is the back end functionality and the Siri half assed implementation.  Anything computer wise, with an operating system designed specifically for the device, has been wildly successful, even though it has been higher priced than other competing platforms.
Yes.
They are competing with HoloLens2… Starting price is the same!!
They probably have better economists than the fed itself which figured out very few takers for the $3500+ headset in this interest rate environment and tech job landscape. Generative AI bots won’t need these xR headsets.
Didn't work out for Google like 10 years ago and it was way less intrusive, this thing is going to en up like their smart speaker
Nah, too invasive and impractical in my opinion, just like 3D televisions, movies, and the metaverse that failed... people just don't want crap on their faces.
Not worried it'll be on your head for so long? Maybe I'm just a pansy, because just having my super light headphones on my head for a movie starts to bother my neck a bit afterwards.
Because they'll pull a Nintendo and only make 1,000 of them to trick the sheep into thinking they are scarce. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Yeah because they will only build 1 a day.
Say what now?
exactly!!
Best case scenario
Did you know the battery is a box you have to carry around and is attached to a long wire? It also only lasts for up to 2 hours?  Two big points that seemed to have been skimmed over.  Besides the fact that there is no practical use case for it. Which is why Google and Microsoft haven't gone anywhere with theirs.
Many such cases
Having an IMAX screen in your house would be nice but shit is way too bulky and I already wear glasses all day and I don't want more shit over my face.  Plus, it would fuck up my hair so the only time you can use one is in your house at night before you go to bed.
Meta headset v3 is also AR, though VR is more of a focus for their business.   The main difference is 1) the visual quality of the Apple on is much higher 2) the hardware is much more powerful 3) the battery is external making the headset lighter and more comfortable but means the battery life is appalling and implies this will be a device you used plugged into the mains.
I thought it was a gimmick when released. Love mine now.  Will always wear it. Perfect compliment to the phone.
For that, I use my Garmin Fenix.
Apple watches are not a status symbol
Lol imagine flexing with $3500, that’s some poor people mentality.
Love the second life ref
I know it’s not for video games I mentioned when I said “Apple expects you to keep this shit on all day”. And it’s not just for devs. Apple is selling this as a product that would replace your phone and is targeting pretty much everybody. It’s a dumb device and just because I don’t want to dump $3500 on a glorified iPhone wrapped around my face doesn’t mean I can’t afford it
How could it go up before an announcement on the news from announcement if it wasn’t announced? The announcement is the rumor
It was already going up
Those goggles are gonna flop harder than the $400 mac pro wheels.
Not at all, they want to launch the pro version first because that will give the niche community to explore and find use cases for it. Rather than the consumers who will do nothing but watch OF in VR 🤣
the hololens that microsoft has given up on? no more development on it, only ongoing support for previous (1 and 2) versions. this is gonna blow those out of the water for sure.
Apple just discontinued its last iPod product- the iTouch- a year ago. It was basically an iPhone without the phone. The other mobile products subsumed its functionality.
Apple is a cult. Tesla is a cult. Nvidia is a cult. Amazon is a cult.
speak for yourself, iJunkie. You'll be shoving an apple iphone on me in my cold, dead hands.  ...my gf wants one though, it's insane.
That's probably the goalof the production cuts lol
Easy to do when you produce a total of 3 units and presell 2 to your GF and her boyfriend. Fake as sales...
$3500 for basically an iphone on your face
Yes, but the market is limited to high dollar payers or corporate
Goog and MSFT both cancelled their crappy glasses. No clue why.
I keep saying that!  Having something on your face triggers a reflex in the reptilian brain because you are, for all intents and purposes, blind. You are all of the sudden unable to tell if a lion is about to attack or if your brother is about to give you a wedgie.   The first idea that comes to mind when I imagine someone wearing a vision pro in the subway is "of all the people here you are first in line to get punched in the head and mugged"
Apple perfects the experience that the others started you know how it is, people will be using this a lot more than you think especially remote tech bros.

Nah, I'm use to having a VR headset on for a few hours. But I can see it being something most people would get annoyed by or cause some strain.
I agree but it won’t be that low obviously
You'll understand when you grow up
Given the specs aren't really available; point #1 & #2 aren't really established yet.  Supposedly the quest 3 has a more powerful GPU, and while the price point should justify top tier optics; this is Apple's first generation device, and everyone else is on their fourth or fifth generation -- there's gonna be a lot of rough edges on this I suspect.  The first generation iPhone sucked, wasn't until the second and third gen before it was usable.
Yeah that’s the thing with Apple, once you have one product of theirs you buy another and another and before you know you’re “stuck” in the Apple ecosystem because it just works well together. I don’t have one myself but my gf does.
Then I guess Apple Watch is used to tell time? Lol
Same reason people buy designer bag, Nike shoes, etc.
No. The rumour was the rumour.
Have a vote "Right". when it comes to 🍎 have yet to see anything bad other than press from hedge funds.  Because thay didn't expect it to go up like that then got press it down to take less of a loss. Thay know what they are doing but sometimes it doesn't work and then we see what we did Friday. As many shares as thay have to see a 2% jump in one day is something that is a preinsight to what is happening.
Post announcement drift is real, fuck EMH.
Yeah but at least it will be 4K and Immersive… if you know what I mean!!
Apple does typically make good products, I’d expect these to be made with the same precision.
It didn’t though. I want a non touch screen dedicated music player with an awesome DAC. iPod classic version 6 upgraded will have to do.
It’s the cult of personality!! If not… At least your singing it now…
Blue Oyster is a cult
Green Message says what?
bitches love apples. look at snow white
How about her other boyfriend?
Probably because her other boyfriend has one.
I don’t get why you think it’s insane. A lot of people prefer iOS and the integration between products is seamless. It’s really convenient. With trade in promos, you can get one for pretty cheap. I’ve been upgrading every 3 years or so and paying $200 every time.
*and hope that someone will find an actual use for them that is worth needing them.  This is Apple's version of a gaming console but that has no games or apps really.
Ha! How true everything you said is, and thank goodness they are wired, or people would wear them in the subway and fall onto the tracks left and right.
Will you buy one?
RemindMe! 1.5 years
They sure have perfected tricking the sheep
We shall see...
The first generation iPhone did not suck. It was transformative.  There was nothing else like it at the time.  Your comments remind me of Ed Colligan, the then CEO of Palm, who famously said in November 2006, a couple of months before the iPhone was released: “We’ve learned and struggled for a few years here figuring out how to make a decent phone. PC guys are not going to just figure this out. They’re not going to just walk in.”
this can be said about anything. same with samsung, google, whatever. All watches are the same, they do nothing extraordinary compared to the rest.
They do exponentially more than just tell you the time?
Indeed, poor people mentality.
No please explain, and then publish it to the journals for the regards to peer review 😇
More cow bell
This reminds me of a coworker who wouldn't shut up about switching to iphone whenever they spotted someone using any non-iphone. They were incredibly stupid, a permanent renter, generally awful with their finances, and borderline tech illiterate. Very obsessed with status though and seemed to have memorized all the bullshit marketing spiel about their phone and saturated themselves in pro-iphone memes. Loved to give younger people advice on finances and tech even though it was clear they were an airhead.  The green text bubble thing was one of their favorite memes.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|27189)
he likes Huawei
that guy is such an asshole, man. Like, at least have the decency to acknowledge that Android is the future of portable tech.
Nothing in an iphone warrants a $1000+ price tag. You are buying the same phone, year after year, and paying $200 for it (after trading in the older iphone). They are a stagnant, complacent company, who know that they are no longer a tech company but a luxury brand. Apple's success is primarily in US and China, the two markets that are more alike. As long as there's that job's saliva-coated half-eaten apple logo, idiots will swallow it whole. Let alone the little issue that Apple moans about, "pRiVaCy" in west, while in China, they happily hand over entire data centers to CCP officials and have pulled apps used by Hong Kong protestors. That's just something beyond comprehension for most losing their mind over that brand name.
Its the slowly coming future but the question is when does it become mainstream
When they release the lite version lol.

I had one, I also had one of the windows CE phones. The latter had far better software.  The first generation iPhone had: - no copy and paste - no ability to run third party apps - a screen that scratched if you put it in a pair of jeans - crap battery life - no 3g support  Along with a host of irritations like not being able to use multiple cell bands, so they only worked in some countries.  The winCE phones actually had all of that, just they were too stylus focused, and the form factor was uglier.  The iPhone really only took off after Apple fixed that stuff in the second and third generation models. Go look at the sales charts.
stock price says otherwise
You need your iPhone with you. Why not just look at your iPhone?
That’s why this sub is catered to

Whichever apple employee came up with the blue text/green text added at least 100 billion of market cap value.
What have android phones done that is so revolutionary?   Samsung charges the same price for their products as Apple, and Apple supports their phones for longer than any android I’ve seen. Paying $400 every 6 years is cheaper than buying an android phone every 5 years for $500. I can also choose to not upgrade at any point, and it will be supported longer than any android phone.   Also the two main options for privacy are Apple and Google. There’s nobody to trust in this situation. 😄 You just have to accept the fact your privacy is likely not taken into high  You should really just let your girl get the phone she wants and stop trying to take the moral high ground. It’s really not a battle worth fighting especially when the other option isn’t any better. You may pay an extra $100-$200 to make your partner happy and get a phone that is supported longer.
When it's not a bother to wear or it's use case out weighs any bother in wearing it.  I have yet to see either.
When they can make it so people who have Motion sickness can use them for longer then 5 -10 minutes.
I’m sure the masses bought more iPhones later.  I had the first generation iPhone and it was incredible compared to phones released months earlier.    By your logic of sales = level of suckiness, the Windows CE phone must have sucked hard because Microsoft got out of the phone business.
Go on
Why do I need my iPhone with me?
I kinda agree with what they're saying, the iPhone wasn't as good at doing the things smartphone users of the time wanted to do,  I remeber discounting it because unlike my Nokia the iPhone couldnt ssh into a server, but we were a very small market with little growth opportunity.  Apple realised the real market for smartphones wasn't smartphone users now, it was regular phone users who would love an easy to use music player, camera and web browser in their pocket. They transformed the market with a product that found a much wider niche than the Windows CE or the Nokia E71.  I suspect they're trying the same with the Headset, creating something that's maybe not great (for the price) as a VR/AR headset, but has a wider appeal than people who want to play immersive video games.
I guess you never owned an Apple Watch?
It feels like you all don’t remember what phones were like before the iPhone.  It was brutal.  I had a handspring with a phone module plugged into it.  It was the most advanced thing at that moment.  It disconnected from the network randomly, the screen resolution was terrible, and it didn’t do a whole lot except let you ssh.    That you both are discounting the magic of the iPhone for these initial imperfections (lack of copy and paste, no ssh app) is insane to me.   The iPhone was amazing at that time even with all its shortcomings.  I also want to add that the screen wasn’t as delicate as the last commenter suggested.  I used the heck out of that thing and it was in pristine condition.  Granted, I dedicated a pocket to the phone and never put anything else in the pocket, but the screen was glass and that was another thing that set the phone apart.  All the other phones at that time had plastic screens.   The original iPhone was objectively amazing.  I think you all need to take a moment to appreciate what that moment in time was like.
I wear an Apple Watch ultra everyday? You do not need your phone on you 24/7.
I'm not discounting it at all, it was amazing and a huge leap forward in a lot of ways, I'm broadly agreeing with you.   But I'm saying Apple looked at the smartphone market and said 'you know what, we think a massive touch screen, iTunes integration and a good browser is going to get us a lot more customers than ssh and copy/paste will so we're going to do that instead' and accept there will be existing smartphone users who are unhappy.   That's Apple's real USP, it's not design (though they are great at that) it's identifying new markets for existing niche products and selling orders of magnitudes more than anyone else thought was possible.
Noice. Apple stocks to $300.
Well, of course.  The product was mostly rushed out the door.  They wanted to bring it to market fast and spent the next year improving the software and building an SDK.  So they focused on features that appealed to the largest segments.   But, it’s also important to note 2023 Apple has way more resources than 2007 Apple.  I guarantee you that anyone who buys the Vision Pro will be blown away and very pleased with it.  Of course it will improve and get cheaper over time, but I have no doubt the initial product will be amazing
Sure this isn’t a normal occurrence that happens every day on hundreds of stocks
i always thought its someone exercising there call options and then it shows that big quick dip down and back up.
You see that lil ol dip right there? That’s when my order sold.
I see this as someone wrote the Telsa 'T' logo right into the afterhours chart. Bullish
You must be new to stocks. This is a Google Finance glitch that has been going on for 5+ years
I checked time and sales. It did not happen. Google is just wrong.
Whats the actual explanation for why this happens lol
I always assumed that was someone trying to trick the system and trigger stop losses.
When I still worked in equities, I don’t anymore but back before the pandemic in the 2018 area, this was almost certainly caused by reporting error, on the CA. Price recording up until I was repositioned was done manually, or at least somewhat manually, this left to incorrect reporting of tx’s, which is ultimately what these charts go off of.  That’s said I know now it is it’s heavily automated, so my only guess interfirm trading, and it’s possible that there’s some kind of contract maybe a call option or the price reporting is purposely obscured. I see it quite often on Google, but not really on Bloomberg. so maybe that has something to do with it. ArcaBook makes it literally impossible to screw it up so I don’t really know.

Damn it, if only my limit order was EXT it would’ve been filled
Im shorting Tesla on earnings day . Mark my words down 10% on bad margins
Blackrock dips crazy after hours
That was my investment, as soon as I bought at 279, it dropped so I sold at 209, bought 200 puts and it jumped back to 279 all within a few seconds.
Stop loss hunt?
Buy the dip!
Tesla puts when
Kathy is at it again
1) That’s not a real price. 2) Get real charting software, and stop being an amateur.
It momentarily showed $290 after that
Hello everyone, a good example of how screwed up the markets are. A sudden drop in value, someone "picks it up" at an under value price. Then it "becomes valuable out of thin air" I say, let's watch the market crash, an "open market" available to everyone. Simple.
It’s a sign bro!!!
Tell me about P/E ratio and why does it matter?
Hmmmmmmm   I want to believe 👽
Tesla stonk make the Tesla logo. Tesla Tesla Tesla
Nope
Holy shit bullish as fuck
Google still using XP service pack1?
Puts on Google.
Possibly Somebody trying do a large limit sell at 290 but typing 209 instead?

That usually only happens with low volume. Most brokerages fill at next available bid if it's a price improvement. So not likely.
Yeah thats strange but wouldnt put too much stock in it
Sure jump on board
Ignorance is clearly healthy.  Be safe
Think i will throw a couple of chips on the table for this.
Wow you’re an idiot
The punchline is before the setup? What a shit meme. OP should feel bad.
Don’t fuck with Spotify. Their suggestion algorithms are the best in the game rn imo.
Spotify is far superior for music. It's not even close.
![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm)
The green and black color scheme reminds me of when my robinhood account was positive
Spotify has rogan. Like seriousxm has stern. Just need one messiah to keep afloat
i have both the biggest difference I've noticed is audio quality. might just be anecdotal but Spotify sounds way better , sometimes you can play an unofficial version of a song.  I also enjoy the Spotify DJ feature pretty cool
Can you make playlists and get artists info in YouTube Premium? Bc I have that and I don’t think I’m using it to its full potential
Bussiness…
Better ai and playlist
Becouse youtube premium sucks tbh. Soundcloud is even better at this point..
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)
Fuck yes!! This! 👆🏻My personal DJ has been recommending some 🔥shit based on my listening profile, and who doesn’t like to see the lyrics of the song you’re playing…Spotify has that.
 In youtube premium you can see videos ad free,play when screen is off , download music.  If you want UI experience similar to spotify you can listen via YouTube music app.  How's spotify better
Yes it may appeal more to the podcast listener.
Yes ,there's add to Playlist feature,  if you want artist info, listen via YouTube music and click on their name when song is playing
Your dumb af! Spotify far better & not comparable. I have all the music at my finger tips organized in every way I want! YouTube premium is just YouTube with no ads. This shit meme too, I can’t believe mods approved this shit ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Bruh you’re ignorant if you think they are comparable
No one downloads music anymore. Videos died with MTV.
Uhhh, besides videos you can listen when the screen is off and download music with Spotify bro, among many MANY other options! Youtube should just stick to videos/visual content.
Gonna cry ?![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|grin)
Don't judge me , judge the apps, dumbass
I’m just perplexed how fucking dumb some people are here! ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
I was just looking at hulu I think last night? The fuck I want to pay a subscription and still have to deal with ads? Who the fuck does that? And like some of it was saying it had ads, then also no ads, but if you pay for the no ads versions a bunch of shows still have ads..    I will have no ads, or else YARRRRR that's just how it is.
I think some companies have determined that providing their content through Netflix is more profitable than going solo.  Why they chose Netflix instead of Amazon?  Who knows.  I'm honestly surprised Netflix hasn't adopted the same subscription model giving studios a platform.  Whatever.  It's a brave new work.  So, final conclusion, I say sideways.
Zaslov is making $100 milly a year burning down WBD. Nice job to have.
Butters called it. All these new streaming services popping up are gearing towards a buyout/licensing deal from one of the first movers like Netflix, Amazon, and Disney. There’s not a viable path to profitability for HBO max/Peacock/Discovery/insert Regarded service here unless they charge a monthly cable price.
Netflix is pound for pound the streaming service champion….hella bullish especially with earnings coming up.
I got 8/18 15c's 2 weeks ago and I've just been letting them cook.
It seems like Netflix is just a dumping ground for the shit product that other streaming services don't want to bother with.
My first VisualMod interaction <3
Yep. Pretty much, after collectively spending about $100b to launch their own streaming services, the content companies (Disney, paramount, wbd, nbc universal, etc) have realized that the cable bundle was a truly amazing business model and that they should get back to licensing their content to other distributors while getting out of the distribution game. Otherwise, they will be crushed by the spending levels of apple, netflix, and Amazon. They don’t have the money to compete.   Since cord cutting will only continue, they might as well license their content to the big guy on the block, Netflix. I expect Netflix to continue to consolidate its leadership position.
Doing technical analysis on the iPhone stocks app is deliciously reckless.
FFS. Candles!
That's definitely some solid consolidation for over a month. Worth keeping an eye on. Thanks for the heads up!
I’ve been bagholding this turd for a couple of years. The only viable path for this POS to go up is to get bought out
I listened to a radio commercial a few days ago where the advertiser, I think it was Allstate, advertised their own world inside roblox universe with a special deal where if you played in it youd ger a discount on their services.  My sisters have spent so much money in the game that I've tied their accounts to my college email, with 2Factor verification   🚀 Bullish
Definitely short term range bound. Planning on opening a put position tomorrow. Probably target a 39.3 exit
I didn't even k ow people still play roblox
Is that a thing?
never faced profit, in a controversy every 3 months, haemorrhaging money towards advertising.... Yeah, this is definitely going in the retirement fund.
Trading range on RBLX?
Did you say Apple $300 end of year? I’m sold.
Using line graphs too
Yeah because paying more the stock price of a company per share is what happens when buyouts happen... GL
Lol what controversies?
google any combination of 'Roblox' and 'pedo' and I'm sure you'll see a couple.
Priced in.
Well we’re Americans, we shoot first and ask questions later. So any firearm or ammo stock
Condom mfgs because we don’t want to catch space herpes while clapping them alien cheeks.
BULLISH. Fed always drops rates during alien invasions
I would assume military stocks may be the play depending on the nature of the announcement. Unless they're peaceful and cooperate, in that case, short mankind technology to oblivion.
Asks how aliens affect the stock market.  Says he made a lot of money, it's $500.  Yup, this post belongs here.
Puts on god.
Puts would fuckin priiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiint!
Literally wouldn’t matter. Our universe would expand beyond Earth. There would be 1 human currency to establish trade with other worlds. This is all if we weren’t eliminated.
The military industrial complex will take over the market. Along with Pharma because of the possible alien diseases.
Airline stocks would crash. Aint no one gonna fly while there's UFOs and shit flying around.
It would depend on wether the aliens are friendly , indifferent, hostile or all of the above.   Or do the aliens have their own stock market? If ever gold might be currency.
>When they do  I believe in alien life, but I don’t believe it could ever reach Earth. The fact that you think extraterrestrials have visited our planet suggests you’re not qualified to make investment decisions (or handle sharp objects). I’m in the same boat, for different reasons, but I’ve done well in index funds and big tech.
I assume energy stocks would collapse since any species capable of interstellar travel would have evolved far beyond fossil fuels.
Probably anything that facilitates trade or communication?
Dude construction, bunkers, safehouses, all kinds of going off grid/underground style shit is going to start happening.

Have you thought about transitioning to asexual?  You will be calmer with surgery and medication.
Aside from the joking nature of this sub, this is actually a pretty interesting question to think about. There is an element of society that will completely accept this and carry on about their normal life. Then you have those that this knowledge will probably completely destroy their belief system. They will cease to function normally and probably go into some sort of panic mode. The real question is how many people will accept it without a problem and how many will go off the deep end.
Any company remotely related to A.I. (alien intelligence) will be stonks and go through the roof.   Think Wall Street knows and already pricing it in.
LMT and NOK calls all the way

Lol I've been wondering the same thing.. keep seeing more and more orbs in the sky. Especially near air force bases. We are being slowly desensitized for some big reveal. The sad thing is that with the internet and globalization, I don't think an alien unmasking would be front page news for more than a couple of days. The next Trump or Russia fiasco would push the aliens to the back page. Unless Trump somehow lumped the aliens in with his campaign I guess...
[removed]
It will definitely help alien stonks…. So anything focused on alien culture, integration or development! Might be a good space to IPO as well if any of you regards want to make a quick 50B.
See I guess it would depend on what they’re here. If they show up because they saw our alien tentacles porn and are down to clown, which stocks should I buy?
Im glad you asked, I was wondering the same thing
The tinfoil industry will make a killing
There will be chaos, the religious belief systems that controls humanity will temporarily collapse
Out of this world gains
Stock market won’t matter. Nothing will matter once we know aliens exist and have their tech. Literally energy is unlimited and you can do anything.
Bullish
It would do nothing.
🅱️liens
LMT might have tech so I'd look there
Go away E.T.
Like the first commercial space flight, it’s probably gonna be a sell the news event.
It depends what information the aliens decide to disclose

Doubt it, Christianity survived the discovery of dinosaurs. It will survive aliens. They'll use as many mental gymnastics as they have to.
I'd say that 15 to 20 percent won't be able to handle it at all. They will have to quit their careers, and they will just have to live in their house and get food delivered and stuff, they won't be able to cope with this new world.
The government has been having soft disclosure for decades to get us ready. The majority of us will just say “we all knew aliens were real” but some will have psychological denial programmed into their brain. Refusal to accept like what you said. I suggest many will pull all their savings and build a bunker. At least a few will. I’m sure it there will be a massive crash in the market which serves as a great entry point. Just like buying bank stocks and DPST at the start of the SVB freakout.
I hope you mean NOC. Unless the alien energy weapons wipe out all modern mobile phones and send us back to the classics.
Me too bro. I also started vaping recently.
Bro it would be front page news every day for years wtf are you talking about
You're right. If aliens are visiting us and not interacting directly then it doesn't affect my life at all. I already operate on the assumption that aliens exist and that intelligent aliens likely exist too. It's not very shocking.
That wasn’t the question tho… aliens don’t trade stocks
Haha.
Imagine all the products that would suddenly sell like hot cakes. Recording of the famous Slim Whitman yodeling CD’s, iodine pills, and tinfoil hats come to mind.
Yeah i remember, nobody tougth of washing their ass.
Source?
I've always know it was LMT, I shouldn't have sold almost at the peak
All the good technology is shelved because if it ever got out I theorize someone with an advanced understanding of physics would be able to severely damage or accidentally genocide maybe a quarter to half the planet, with improper experimentation, i.e. in fiction the generation of a black hole that consumes the planet or accidentally lighting the atmosphere on fire.
There are so, soooooo many depressed virgins that could have their life changed for the better. I think it’s bullish
OK. And where is the evidence that that is possible?  Speak slowly, because some of us aren't tripping as hard as you.
That's an interesting point but dinosaurs were known about for a very long time. The word dinosaur was made up by the archaeological conservancy in England in the late 1800's. Before that The skeletons were commonly referred to as dragons, and have been found throughout the world for thousands of years.
This is a UFO thread, not COVID.
I highly doubt it. One great argument was brought up by Eric Weinstein. The top experts in physics are well known. During the Manhattan project it was known experts were being sent to one location to work on some unknown project at the time. There's no evidence of that today. The world's most renowned experts aren't spending their time on aliens according to people within the physics community. Another good counterargument is one against the recent influx of "UAP" videos. Many have been debunked, such as the Gimbal video which ironically was named after the visual distortion they initially thought it was. Then there's the "Go Fast" video which was determined to be moving a **lot** slower than what was initially suspected. Then there were the recent Chinese spy balloons that were shot down in North America that NORAD had no idea of for a while proving there is tech that is operating in our atmosphere that it of human origin and is confounding our systems. There's also the fact that the vast majority of UFO sightings have occurred in the U.S. which coincides with their popularity here as opposed to in other nations. It's a self fulfilling fantasy, which is a known psychological phenomenon.
I can never tell if people are serious or demented on here...
Yeah, a TRUE disclosure would have people talking about it 24/7. You'd be so sick of it after a year or two.  We haven't seen anything like a TRUE disclosure. Nobody is really believing all of this yet.
That aliens exist? Doubt it. We have gov. officials leaking truth now and all people want to talk about is Tesla and inflation. Alien invasion, different story. And that's only because people's internet/5g would probably be wiped out and people would freak out over no internet, not the aliens.
How would you know, earthling?
Even hot cakes!
Teepees
Trust me bro.

It’s all hearsay, but enough for me to raise an eyebrow. If true I’m sure it has boosted their stock for decades now. But if Lockheed hits 1000 in 20 years you know why
https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/14n2qrj/ross_coulthartprivate_aerospace_company_lockheed/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=1&utm_term=1
It's kind of a known thing in UFO circles. If there's a coverup, they're involved. They're first in line, in fact.
They'll be a scapegoat in the whole thing if it happens.  Initially, the stock will pop, because people will think this is a great thing for LMT. However, then, they will be thrown under the bus. They will have to relinquish all technology, have all related patents revoked, etc, etc. They'll also be fined billions.  They won't go bankrupt over the whole thing, but this will not be something that longterm LMT holders will be enjoying, unless they dump their shares off the initial misguided run up.
Dude the evidence is right here: https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ
The point is that dinosaurs died off 65 million years ago which predates the origin date in the bible
What if Covid came from UFOs? 🤯
Alien, UFO, COVID all have vowels in them, same thing.
Too much time on Reddit gets to these guys
People don’t care about the gov officials “leaking the truth” because there’s zero evidence. If there was actual proof, every person alive would be interested.
I’m undercover. Come pick me up. Beaming my coordinates rn.
https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/14pv72h/senator_harry_reid_about_ufos_kept_secret_by/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=1&utm_term=1
I honestly believe if we have legit disclosure that LMT will crash hard, because they will become a scapegoat in the whole thing.  The alien technology that they received for free from the government, wasn't rightfully owned by the secret government cabal that was in control of it. They didn't have legal authority to posses it, nor to give it to their favorite contractors. Lockheed would be holding these materials under illegal means, and would need to relinquish everything.  They also would be fined billions.  I personally wouldn't expect them to go bankrupt in the entire deal, but I see it as a net negative overall. I'd rather own puts 3 years out, then calls.  However, in the extremely short term, when all this first breaks, if people don't realize that these contractors are going to get thrown under the bus, they could spike pretty dramatically before later suffering the backlash.
Lol, if what you're suggesting is true, 1000 is nothing. It'll likely be 1000 or more in 20 years due to inflation alone.
I hope you're right. I just hope whatever happens is plain truth, and not whatever "facts" mainstream media cherry picks as truth.
Skunk works, and others, used to release all sorts of misinformation hogwash, as a cover for whatever top secret project was in the works....just sayin.
Holy shit a source of some random US military fuck saying something. It's always words. Empty fuckin words with no actual evidence.
Imagine going through live thinking that this nonsense is actually real.
What whole thing? Is there any concrete proof that there’s actual alien tech outside of someone just promising there is? This is all so weird to see people so confident there’s UFO’s when any alien civilization that could make it here would definitely have the tech to not be held by the government 😂
If money addiction and oil as a fuel source is the reason for the concealment anti-gravity technology, understandably typically greedy, but if it's not being released because someone that harbors a grudge against something finds out it can be used for planetary obliteration, I never want to see that until everyone physically and mentally evolves maybe in 50,000 to 100,000 years.
It would be the biggest story in human history, by a long shot. It would change everything, for a very long time.
You must not be in the loop. It’s okay. You’ll find out in a couple years
Imagine going through live.     Through live.
We've never been closer to Disclosure than we are right now. Of course, the whole thing could easily be rug pulled and not happen. It could all be a hardcore tease
But *why* are we close to this disclosure? Saying we’re close to disclosure implies that there’s already proof and we’re just waiting to be told if you guys are right. I’m asking what the proof is.  If my girlfriend asks me “when are you gonna tell me about the ring?” Then that implies that there actually is a ring, and that they have evidence of it to confront with. Where’s the evidence that can’t be chalked up to birds or military top secret tech? Those options both just feel infinitely more likely than aliens who just let us take their shit lol
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSj7QsHRxHQ&t=346s
Yeah again that isn’t proof. Not gonna watch a video of some guy who wants his time on the news lol. My uncle was in the air force and claims he’s been abducted like 20 times and can speak with aliens, I don’t believe him either. People lie all the time, actual proof is the important part.  Would you believe it if some retired military official told you that Bigfoot was real?

Priced in, it's going to tank
But Tesla isn't priced on being able to sell a moderate number of cars at discount prices. Seems just as likely their share price will drop on this news.
Trashla 👍
Fasten your seatbelts and ensure your trays are in the upright position, folks, because Tesla's stock is currently defining what it means to soar. This is no ordinary rally - it's a turbocharged, full-throttle ride that's making gravity jealous.  The sheer electric energy that's buzzing through the market right now is palpable. Investors are no longer simply watching - they are part of a phenomenon, dancing to the rhythm of rising digits and swelling portfolios. The skeptics are being left in the dust, squinting at the rocketing trajectory that's lighting up the financial night sky.  Wall Street is spinning. Analysts, clutching their tried-and-trusted textbooks, are witnessing a stock chart that seems to be making a mockery of conventional wisdom. But Tesla has never been about the conventional, has it? It's been about the extraordinary, the futuristic, the game-changing.  Congratulations are in order for the early birds and the stalwart believers. This is your victory parade - but not in slow motion, rather in ludicrous speed, around the circuits of the market's grand prix. Mr. Market, standing on the sidelines, can't help but nod in approval, realizing that Tesla's ascent is not just a surge, but a statement.  The message is clear: the future is electric, and it's happening right now. Tesla's stock isn't just defying gravity; it's etching a trail for the world to follow - a trail lit by the sparks of innovation, sustainability, and relentless ambition. So here's to the ride of our lives - may it continue to electrify, inspire, and, above all, accelerate!
Down 8% tomorrow.  TSLA cult takes a $2B increase QoQ sales, and a $1B beat, and thinks that’s going to solidify the 33% gain since Q1 deliveries?  They’ve added $275B in market cap since Q1 deliveries dropped, and only added $2B in revenue…  NVDA would be jealous of that…
Tesla is going to go down like $10 this week
Idk if anyone will see this please help me out school and work is hard anything will help $devking89

In a way, yes
I belive it is a bristlenose pleco, eating the algae, they do clean glass and such in case there is some fish lying at the bottom this can happen but i would not consider this common and really harmful to the other fish.

Tesla dropped prices significantly to sell more cars. Imagine the disappointment when we find out revenue is not up despite the sales bump.
Tesla takes so much government money, those price cuts are factored in. Uncle Joe’s administration is the biggest EV investor this FY. The money they lost from 460k vehicles with 25% price cuts is still less than what the government gave them this year.
ChatGPT you crayyyyyyzy
It's up 5% in afters right now
Tesla at $255 by tomorrow, bro.  Watch.
It doesn't count unless you swallow
Oh no I mean when I buy calls tsla will dump. That's what i do
I'm buying $6000 worth of spy calls and $600 worth of tsla calls. So far my luck has been shit for past 3 years. If this changes it, I'm fine with it but I doubt it
Maybe, maybe not
Ok 👌

No no. That's not how this works. They are deciding if regular Joe rubes think that the price will go up. If they determine that the answer is yes, they will front run them by buying now and selling back to them at a profit. There's always a quick profit to be made on the news and it always disappears by the next day.

Nice,  good luck on your trade.
How can a company with $11 Billion in average yearly net income, on par with Amazon, since 2012 with no signs of slowing, is still trading under $100?  I'm bag holding at $99 but it amazes me how it went sideways for months now the minute I get in the trade. Anyways, hope you're right OP, I'll take any upward movement.
I see both the bull and bear thesis as valid. That being said I am long 85$ calls as long as closes stay above 83. If the bull case plays out longer term target 110-120

China isn’t supporting Russia anymore than India or Israel are. It’s the larger state of geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China that spooks institutions.
I remember hearing in a documentary once something like "in China the leader doesn't change but the policy is always changing, but in the US, the leaders constantly change but the policy stays the same"  That really stuck with me.
I think you have it backwards. Policy changes with the leader every 4-8 years in the US, like at roe vs wade. China has been consistent with it’s policy for the last few decades and it shows in itMs double digit growth.

Real problem for AMD isn’t performance, it’s the CUDA moat
Market is big enough for both to exist and make ALOT of money in the space.
Sure, and I could make a million dollars by buying the right calls.. doesn’t mean its gonna happen
this seems to be a few stretches.  "could," "80% (vs a100)," and mi300 vs h100, when the mi300 has never been benchmarked.
Cuda, hard ware and network, all together,
Chip makers aren’t the play.  Find who the AI advertisement company will be.  Google emerged from the intrawebs.   Whoever is Google of AI is the play.   Period.   I’m betting on MSFT.   Http://build.Microsoft.com
AMD needs to donate $100m GPU clusters to the top 20 AI research universities. Then they will start gaining traction.
Honestly amd just needs to have a half decent offering while the market is in its infancy. Probably they are not going to be as good as nvidia once you consider there software solutions basically already being used. But that doesn’t mean AMD can’t carve out a profitable section out of a new booming sector.
Everyday now, there’s an article out on NVDA. Stock is going to 1,000 by years end at this rate
Move over, Nvidia. AMD's AI chips are here to give you a run for your money! 😎💪
We just need more developments like that by MosaicML: [https://www.mosaicml.com/blog/amd-mi250](https://www.mosaicml.com/blog/amd-mi250)     Like someone already said in this thread, AMD just needs to make a ton of GPU donations to research institutions. We'll figure out how to make those GPUs work for our problems once we have them...
It could, but AMD will still destroy your money. Long, short, all the same.
AMD couldn’t make a decent processor back in the day and now they are claiming to have made an NVIDIA competitor. It will never happen, but who cares, stock may go up on chanting AI.
Of course it can... You have only to wait for 12 to 18 months for AMD to match Nvidia performance.
Not without the raw materials needed to make them. China is cutting them off
Haha, forget Skynet! AMD's AI chips are taking over Wall Street!
This maybe true. But AMD should put their pride where their PR campaign is and submit their results for the MLPerf benchmark. Until then, all I see is a company trying to calm down it’s nervous investors.
AMD is the chad
PC gamers reading this and looking at gpu prices in continued despair.
Doesn’t stuff like MosaicML basically abstract all that away?
What CUDA. do you really think that’s something google engineers can do given an year.
I have amd shares so I’ll believe what you say
Noone is close to Nvidia, sadly - this coming from an AI engineer.
What market? I haven’t seen A.I. generate a single penny yet for anyone but the stock market. SHOW ME THE MONEY!
Facts! I don’t know why everyone is acting like AMD is doomed to fail. Even more so, Intel.  The technology is still new. Heck, there might even be a dark horse competitor out of nowhere that may be more profitable than Nividia
The AMD problem is software. NVDA CUDA is so well established that most customers won't even considerer an alternative.
August earnings will blow past expectations. Will likely raise guidance again.
Regard with no idea how market cap works^^
Google is going to build their own hardware if they want to depart from CUDA and think it makes sense business-case wise. The price of them rewriting the code base is going tbe more than switching to Nvidia for 50 years.
I can see it going to $150
i hate Nvidia, i want to believe what he sais, with the caveat that nvidia eats some humble pie
But if there was a company that could produce GPUs/chips similar to what Nvidia is offerring what company other than AMD could it be?
You have no idea what you're talking about
At the last NVDA earnings call, Jensen announced that they expect gross revenues of $11B, a huge upwards movement, beat analyst estimates by over 50% ($7B). They explained most of it was driven by data center sales, with CSPs being majority of the customers.
It takes some time for the AI software to be created and tested but soon, in the next 6 months we'll start seeing much more advanced AI developments. More money going into it. Earnings going higher, along with unemployment.   AMD reports earnings in early august, NVDA in mid August. Earnings will crush expectations and guidance will go up again.
because nvidia skullfucked them.  they have nothing.  intel won't have anything viable in forever and amd won't have anything til next year, and probably with no real volume.  nvidia not only has the product, but already ramped it up.  there are supply bottlenecks in place and amd is basically fucked.
>NVDA CUDA is so well established that most customers won't even considerer an alternative.  And the way to change that is to have the researchers use AMD products and publish  software on the AMD stack.
Its easy, use AI to make AI software and build a competitive  platform and maximize efficiency.
Google has been making their own machine learning optimized TPUs for a long time you ding dong.
lol! the hyperbole is awful! 50 years !! I have done many projects using CUDA and have developed many libraries like CUDA, I know what I'm talking about. If I hear Huang saying NVDA moat is CUDA, I will immediately take it as they are feeling the crunch and immediately go short !
Those are rookie numbers. I can see PT $420.69
I bought at 65 so 🤷‍♀️
I too own puts
No company is remotely close to producing what Nvidia can…there are many distant #2’s, but none of them are close enough to even be considered a competitor right now
Ok genius show me who is using A.I. to generate revenue.
Can you explain
Right- and I don't see the expenditure materialising. This is hype.
Is that a one time revenue bump or will this $11B / quarter revenue continue or grow over time?
Yes but my point was there currently is no market it has to be created and no one knows how big it’ll be so far all we have is hype
Will we? I thought it was making bank next month for NVIDIA!
well it seems like they are finally making steps back into relevance by adding software that could run AI software on their cards  that is still a huge moat for nvidia but sooner or later amd had to get to work on that
> on the AMD stack  what amd stack?  they're relying on rocm, pytorch, etc.
I don't. I just hate them lol
Google, Amazon and Meta for example
Telemarketers
Yes. "AI" in this context is the next iteration of things that already exist, and soon to come things that don't but are easy reaches.  Every automated voice system you've ever talked to is "ai" in this parlance/context. And they will get better rapidly in the next 5 years.  The majority of mundane daily articles written about stocks and business news has also been automatic and revenue generating.  The technology to automate a jobs has never been easier. The pressure for companies to spend to automate jobs has never been there until now. Everyone's worried about ai, that means budgets open up.  GPU in the datacenter/hyperscaler is where the spend will be for the next 20 years. It will be combined with decentralized traditional x86/arm/best power/efficiency.   Maybe if you're older like me you remember a thing called seti, where NASA used decentralized compute to pour through data that they never could have on their own. That is the future of everything general compute, as opposed to specialized GPU needs in the background.  I haven't even begun to mention the applications for industry, energy and manufacturing specifically. Or universities and thought processes.
What are you saying? The revenue is already booked, devices are already sold, nvda made the money. You guys are regarded.
Famously Nvidia never releases better products every 18 months and AI models never increase in complexity and number of parameters. This is good because datacenter hardware doesn’t have a 3-4 year lifecycle.
True, you just have to wait until the AI app store is compete. Its in process.
no idea why you said that to me.  amd's relying on open source software.  and like i said, software isn't exactly their biggest problem - the mi300s are basically vaporware.  and the first gazillion are going to el capitan for pennies.  nvidia already ramped, cowos is bottlenecked.  mi300s won't really exist til q1, and even then... they'll probably have no volume for ages.  nvidia absolutely murked amd.
>what amd stack?  they're relying on rocm, pytorch, etc.  As apposed to cuda, pytorch, etc
Stfu then lmao
They’re not generating any income from A.I yet you fuck nut
And how many of the tens of Billions projected for income next month are they providing? I don't see a great deal of expenditure just yet on their sheets.  Hardware is already way far ahead. This is hype.
And how exactly are they using A.I. to generate income?  Edit: saw a response before it was deleted and this is my answer-  They’ve been doing that for years now using a form of chat bot it isn’t new and that’s not classed as A.I. because it’s pre programmed. Think harder
*whoooooosh*
You're highly regarded. They all have been using AI for a long time. Have you ever tried google search?
Yes and that’s a search algorithm not A.I.
It’s keeps pumping even after the earnings dip. I have sept 20$ calls and I want to sell but it keeps going up on the daily 😂
Hot damn!
That CCL is so hot right now
have a feeling we gunna see the same pattern this year as we saw last year with the bouncing between 15-25 range
Congratulations!
Where did CCL say they weren't going to sell more shares ?
Congratulations OP!
Sold too soon..
u/TheRealGreenArrow420 ^ this could be you bro
Thanks baby.
lmao
I know the feeling man, I kept going back and forth for the past week on what I wanted to do. I’ve had some bad experiences in the past with holding too long and didn’t want to make the same mistake again.
Matched only by Hansel.
Thank you!
Thank you!
It’s possible, but happy with the gain regardless.
Who are you why are you tagging me?
What are you thinking Ccl does over the next few months?
Sorry, I meant that I sold too soon...last week 😅.  Congrats!!
I’m no expert by any means, but it’s been such an impressive run-up that I expect some sort of pull back. I don’t know how far or for how long but I think $18 is a comfortable stable range for it near term while they continue to prove their path forward works (solid bookings, paying down debt, etc).   I know they have said they don’t intend to do anymore offerings but you have to think the thought is in their head a little, I hope they don’t but I have to imagine it’s a chance.
Ohhh, gotcha. A win is a win! Thank you!
More text = More losses. Post losses.
Once a gay bear always a gay bear
Too long, didn't read.  Are you asking us to pray that shit away or something?
I been hoarding cash instead of investing for 2 years. No vacation only work to hoard money. I know have an enormous amount of cash in a high inflation period with possibly a 30% loss of gains from not investing in index funds.
It's an election year cycle coming up. Billionaires will be fighting each other to get their candidate in. I expect a sideways market, unless there is a consensus on a candidate, positive market for Dem, negative for Repub. After that, we'll see.  2022 was negative until October that year, Repubs took the house and evened the Senate.
Your mama bear shoulda sent u to the Billy Bulls Bible Camp to pray this shorting away.
You probably were really born a bear “born this way” you just didn’t realize it or was denying your bear urges or not aware of your true desire. BUT, There is no such thing as overvalued in ponzi fiat…. Which is intrinsically valued at zero! Ok how is that for conversion therapy? All fiats do die and thousands have proved it even several currently in hyperinflation today. In hyperinflation stonks also hyperinflate forever just fyi.
Congrats on coming out during pride month 🏳️‍🌈
Stocks only go up though
Man you are going to be poor forever
I got mad OTM calls baybeeee 🚀
Origin stories are always great, can’t wait to see the bull origin version
Dude no one is reading all that nonsense.  You're just another 🌈 🐻
I ain’t reading alldat
I ain't reading all that but happy for you
Mom, dad: I’m poor.
People see 5% rate thinking it is not much a difference compared to 2%
> 2022 and I got rich while everyone was sucking dicks behind Wendy's   Please elaborate on precisely how?  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  Was it to completion, or?
Quitter
In time, I will go back to being a bull.
How the fuck are you supposed to know what to pray if didn't read?
"You lose more waiting for corrections than from corrections themselves." Warren Peter Buffet Lynch
You would be losing around 20% on purchase power. 2022 was like -30% including inflation.  That will be better than losing 50% in an upcoming crash.
I just read that with a southern accent.
There’s always bear conversion therapy behind the Wendy’s.
Interesting theory. The ponzi fiat does have a value (for now) because I can exchange that paper with old dudes on it for goods/services. Although I believe the US is an empire in decadence, their coins are still valuable. I don't think I'll see the USD dissappear, but eventually it will happen.  The hyperinflation cycle has happened and my stonks inflated along, but that's not the case anymore.
I'm not.
It's 20 times what it used to be for the las 15 years.
I shorted bitcoin, tesla and nasdaq to the tits.
So your like a trans marketfluid investor
Title.
I’m starting to think there won’t be a crash. I don’t know how it hasn’t happened yet. It’s like we have been living on the edge for more than a year
😂 it was a 50% crash or more for most stocks
LIES !!! Just terrible blowjobs and a mouthful of jizz.
Only able to exchange on a limited small scale as long as no one else is. But the veil could be pulled any second. Hyperinflation has not even started that is just regular inflation.
I was asking how everyone was sucking dicks behind Wendy's. I need to know if it's worth a visit.
Or like a hermaphrodite investor
I read that as Titie and it made me laugh. ( • )( • )
We have all seen the truck about to crash video, but we also know how that ends.
Ohh, well, I actually didn't see anyone giving BJ's, most are through WSB references.

I’ll buy some $60p 7/21 as a gamble. Thanks for the fun idea broski!
What your price target? 60P for this week only 3cent....so cheap for bad news.  Are people not expecting any further decline?
You son of a bitch, I’m in
You son of a in I’m bitch
Thanks, OP. Loading a few puts on them Wednesday.
Remind me in 5 days
Stock is traded in London and exchange will be open tomorrow - could be a useful indicator for Wednesday.  There was some bounce in London this evening after close.   I'm interested in this as I have a play going the other way.
So in other words, lung cancer patients died of lung cancer.  I’m not moved
OP in fact, will not add to position tomorrow.
It went up in UK today no ?!
Interesting $mrna is also investing in China. https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-04/moderna-to-announce-1-billion-in-china-investments-yicai-says
You're welcome broski. Good luck with all of your trades!
Giving this a go too. Not usually a gambler, but I have never seen almost unanimous agreement in the comments
$60 EOW. I can see it dropping further next week around $52-55 as people slowly continue to dump for the next week to 10 days. I have seen this time and time again with biotech stocks and poor trial results. Puts for the stock were attractively priced so that's why I grabbed some at close.
I was wondering that, was it a one time 8% drop or will ir keep dropping
You're welcome. Good luck with all your trades/investments!
Definitely could be!
it went up a little?   [https://www.londonstockexchange.com/stock/AZN/astrazeneca-plc/company-page](https://www.londonstockexchange.com/stock/AZN/astrazeneca-plc/company-page)
“AstraZeneca said some patients suffered a side-effect that caused lung scarring, although no more than in previous trials, with the majority classified as “low grade”, although there had also been some “grade 5” events, which means deaths.”
In addition, the details on any “charity “work or climate change mitigation is always purposely vague by these big corporations. If you look at that press release you linked, some of their initiatives that they’re involved with that will use some of that $400 million, are initiatives that last 30 years. And if they ever get in financial trouble, there is nothinh binding them to these ecological projects. I wouldn’t worry about it from a stock price perspective
I meant Wednesday lol. Forgot markets are closed tomorrow!
no it didn't
I think it will keep dropping. Especially since today was a shortened trading day, I think volume will accelerate Wednesday and will go into next week as laggards sell. I also do not see any good news/catalysts on the horizon for the company.
Yes. I have a lot of contracts going the other way, so if there is an opportunity to get out, hopefully this will be it. 2% up will translate as a 200% gain.  I don't disagree with the analysis above or the field in general when I look through the charts for PFE (Pfeizer) and AZN. The only issue is potentially another announcement which lightens the general interpretation of the first.  Depending on how it looks tomorrow (I hate early trading), I will add some puts. Looking to take 2/3rds of current position out, keep 1/3rd in, and re-post 1/3rd as puts. I don't see there being sideways movement for the whole 10 days so I'll hope to trap myself in a no-lose scenario. I do need a bit of time so I'm hoping it isn't a major rise or dump early on.
ok nvm RIP
You might want to smoke a joint before making any investment decisions.
Goddamn Canopy Growth hit a 50% today. that’s wild
I might buy some too lol.
Get ready to experience your first -100% on a share play
Good to see someone making money on weed stock leaps.  For me, I would of lost less if I rolled my joints with twenties, and I smoke a lot.
I bought when they were low, now they're lower.
Nice, I'm not the only regard doing autistic shit like this...love to see it!
A YOLO on $YOLO.  I've been waiting for this one.
I fucked with TLRY for a nice gain two weeks ago. Gonna fuck around with it again as I liked the buying I saw the past few days
Ahh yes. Catching a falling knife. At least you used options. They’re always the safer bet
Lmao you bought the shittiest weed stock you could
I bought a few etfs only cost me $15 see if they come back.
Weed is seasonal business bro. Usually grows begin spring time into summer (12-16 week cycles) where the flowering begins when the days start getting shorter (Summer celestial) Then the curing of the plant, drying, packaging, distribution. Then, those numbers would show Q4, maybe even Q1.  Year round grows are done in facilities where the metrics of their production can easily be measured.   Also, any weed stock that's not in, or planning to be in, the largely unregulated market of Hemp products is a no go.
So puts on pot?
I trade while high very often. Not sure it makes me a better or worse trader, but it certainly makes the day more fun
Don’t tell me how to gamble my money you soulless bot cuck
W visual mod puts out another banger piece of advice
It's also gone down nearly every day for 5 months straight, which is very impressive.
This isn’t shares in the screenshot.  He is holding 500 1.50 strike 19 January 2024 calls.
Lol certainly possible if I were holding shares
This is the way
This is the way
All facilities in Canada are indoors to the best of my knowledge, Aurora, Tilray, Canopy.
No, calls
Bro ur suposed to sell high, not buy. Only smoke before you sell
Absolute wisdom right here
It makes me  way way worse.  Stimulants get me going
No no he is telling you to GET HIGH and then when you are HIGHER than you’d like to be, then sell.
Didn't see that, even worse tbh !
Holy fuck you just discovered the ultimate hack
So glad im holding a contract
Looks like he’s looking out a Wendy’s drive through window
Pretty obvious who has puts here. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|18630)
So I don't know I'm trying to learn the game, but I've got 30 share of tesla that I've had for 3 years now. I just ride the wave and see what happens.

Lmao! There were people here calling me dumb when I was buying @ $120 a few months back. Saying it was going to $50. 🤣😂
Just wait for the truck
I wouldn't be surprised if $TSLA gets to 300$ EOW
Never bet against a company that has a cult following lmao
$300 by friday
Lol the shorts doing contortionist gymnastics to spin this into a bad thing. Haha you in pit now!
You better keep those Beady eyes buried mf
🌈 Ladies and Gentlemen, boys and girls, the Tesla Bears 🐻 are not just seeing red right now, they're seeing the entire spectrum of a panic-induced rainbow! 🌈 Looks like they're finding it a little hard to bear after the latest blowout delivery report from our dear Mr. Musk's electric wonderland.  In an alternate universe, where EVs are a myth and gasoline is the nectar of the gods, these Bears 🐻 might have been the Wall Street soothsayers. But alas! We live in a world where the hum of an electric motor drowns out the growls of these naysayers.  Isn't it fascinating how the mere mention of Tesla's achievements is enough to transform these once ferocious Bears 🐻 into jittery jellies, quivering at the sight of each new Model 3 and Model Y hitting the roads? You could almost hear the panicked whispers in the wind, 'Can we short-circuit these electric machines?'  Ladies and gents, grab your popcorn 🍿 and enjoy this spectacle as the Bears scramble to make sense of a future that's electric, bright and filled with more Teslas than they ever dared to imagine. Yes, Bears, you better fasten your seatbelts - it's going to be a bumpy, electrified ride! 🌈🐻⚡️
Going all in Monday so it reverses and bears can eat
LMAO. You get a blowout by giving low guidance. It is old Wall Street trick.   The increased sales are due to slashing prices and federal tax credits.
HAHA have fun eating your 6 dollar combo meal at Wendy’s TSLA Bers!! I kept my calls through that 238 drop because I was waiting for estimates and now my time will finally come this week😤
Wait til you see how far their margins compressed due to slashing prices continually throughout the year. Top line revenue growth and unit volume growth without bottom line earnings growth is meaningless. You end up like Toyota which is worth 1/4 of Tesla. Tesla had massive revenue and unit volume growth in Q1 but their margins compressed from 29% to 19% and their earnings dropped -24% YoY.
When elon made a statement telling investors not to overleverage, i knew it was gonna be something big
Ah man couldnt read this because of Twitters limitations on post!
Since y’all talking shit about Elon - I mean Tesla - I’ll just go buy calls on Monday for the 1st time.   It definitely cannot go tits up….right? RIGHT??
You know the demand is there when even I want a Tesla now.
So the casino is open?
If you’ve learned anything here its that if you bet TSLA will go down/stay down you’ll lose
Good growth and love my Model S Plaid, not a stock I'd want to own at these prices.
Bear hole.
 If Tesla releases there cyber truck the bear might go away and the bull will come.
1k tesla by next friday
Thank you lord, for once in my life I'm on the winning side
Number one rule of Wall Street. Nobody - and I don't care if you're Warren Buffet or if you're Jimmy Buffet - nobody knows if a stock is going to go up, down, sideways or in circles.  Still holding 100 300c 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Should I buy TSLA tomorrow?
2030 - Tesla is going to make Apple look like BBBY.
Let's lower the estimates reallllly low, cut prices on the cars, and deliver the cars in a timely manner this quarter. BOOM record numbers. It's textbook Wall Street. They will be positioned exactly as they set it up for come tomorrow.

You realize that they made that number after MULTIPLE rounds of price cuts / incentives on top of the MULTIPLE rounds of price cuts / incentives from Q1, right?    OP's post is exactly what I'd expect from a SIMP.  So focused on unit #'s that they are completely oblivious to the margin carnage needed to get there.  By all means, PLEASE run up the SP this week & ahead of earnings.  Anyone with an actual brain knows Q2 financials will be ugly.  Additionally, keep in mind that in the past ~week, the following has happened:  - Elon has been warning people about holding $TSLA shares on margin.  "While long term price will appreciate, there could be *lol* irrational *lol* variations in the short term".  - Cathy Wood has dumped a fair # of $TSLA shares even after going on TV talking a bout $2K/share price targets.    - In June, alone, insiders have sold > 100K shares.  There has been *ZERO* insider purchasers in the past 12 months.
Throw some gasoline down there toss a match
I got a nice call for 7/21 just before the bell. I am so glad. Bears 🐻 be 💩ing
I bought leap 2024 calls after last earnings. Life is good.
Tesla's valuation has nothing to do with deliveries bro. If it did, it would be like 10x less.
My favorite bear quote.  “The competition is coming “. Lol. Tesla to the moon
The anti-Tesla reddit brigade in shambles
I remember the last great report (Q4 21?) from telsa and the stock dropped so I guess we'll see
Deliveries are meaningless since profits are down.
Who the hell still shorts in 2023
Stock won’t be going up on this news pal

Where is gordon johnson???
They’re seething at ridiculous levels
Calls on Monday for the early sales report. I made money Friday from Daddy Elon too.
 * * My Target is $380 in 2mon
Tesla is my long term hold, I just think that it will keep going up. With the usual dips of course, also have J&J and Cummins. But only been investing for 3 years, self taught so I no nothing really. Also have 2 etfs and 2 Roth ira
Are we going to the moon tomorrow?
300c gonna print boys
They blew out estimates last time too and still dumped 10% at earnings. Tesla isn’t a “normal” stock
400 here we go
I remember when “TSLA dOwN tO $50!!!” was common talk around here  Get rekt bears
[deleted]
800+ billion dollar market cap....... Yeah I'm still out here. It's already priced in.
OP just single handedly ensured a tsla dump tomorrow.
rip bears
TESLA AND APPLE WILL MOVE BIG NASDQ WILL BE A STEAM ROLLER THIS WEEK!
When this EV fad finally blows up in people’s faces, Tesla will evaporate into thin air.
Last time TSLA released good news ahead of earnings like this, they dumped hard
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
No matter what the news, the market already had priced it in
Where can I find out how many of these cars are fleet buys because I think the bear is sharping it's teeth in there.
I imagine how untrustworthy and dishonest Tesla management is. Elon is a snake oil salesman that failed to deliver all his promises. Many other companies collapsed for much smaller misleading promises.  [insert "how can he get keep getting away with this" meme from Breaking Bad]  If Tesla is that good of a business who, in fact, is in charge?
Jesus, I’ve been watching way to many drone videos coming out of Ukraine, my brain immediately started looking if there were guys in that hole
Priced in.
Buy the rumor sell the news. 🧐
It would be interesting if the price action is sell the news.
Wait. They're still selling ev's right? Time to open a short position
What is going up?
Watch it going up, it’s crazy
Lmaoo
He just nuked twitter again. Seems to have always had a negative impact on Tesla stock so we shall see.
Fuuuuck
😂😂🤑
Oh she’s going to pop people and pop BIG
Put your nosy Rose in there

Tesla bears are the most depressed group of people on Earth.  I love laughing at them.
Oh thank all the people that are currently working at Wendy's right now for giving me this chance to get back into the game..
OP lives for upvotes lol
Well. My 270c expired worthless this week. Now that I’m out, it’s time for it to send so I can fomo back in and get burned again.
Looks like the bears need a Tesla to lighten up their mood! 🐻🚀
TO DA MOON BABY!!!!
Looks like the bears are sleeping while Tesla keeps roaring! 🚀😄
Just put a sell order for my 60 shares I bought in 2015.
Guess it's time for the bears to take a long hibernation! 🐻💤
I… I don’t know if that’s good or bad
Waiting for a boolw to cross the bridge
Tesla and Elon fuck yeah.
It's it too late to enter?
i have one $300 7/14 call. Please hit $300 on monday!
I told them it was going to $300 or over that’s exactly what those 🐳 want and that’s where it’s going
the moment wsb agrees a stock goes into one direction its time to load options going the other way 🐻📉🌈
*Imagine* not buying TESLA when it hit the low $100s last December.      Just imagine

Bought a fuckin put on Friday lol rip
Thanks for the post! Bought and sold this morning and made myself some change.
I’m holding it through ER.  2000% or to 0🚀🚀🚀
4% above consensus is not exactly a blowout, especially with all the incentives during the quarter.
Always inverse your intuition it’s going down
 Found him. Knew someone was lurking here throwing their whole portfolio at Tesla puts
I have 5 $420 calls expiring 12/15 LOL!    I got them for an average of $6.83, purchased on 6/23 & 6/29, and as of close Friday, it was trading at $6.23, so what was a casino play, may end up actually making me some money, but hopefully more than I expected. We shall see

this better not be some sell the news shit cuz i added bunch of call spread when it lost 245s.
I don't fuck around with Tesla one way or the other.  It's obviously a massively overvalued meme stock but trying to short a bubble is playing with fire.  These numbers are fully consistent with my view that Tesla is worth 1/5th of the current market cap.  I think Tesla is a good company with solid growth potential. You think it's a magical fucking unicorn that farts rainbows.
Guilty as charged 🙃 Monday is going to hurt 🍆

Remember to sell high.
I'm currently at 55 shares, also bought nearly 3 years ago. Currently up $5,066 and holding.
Sitting on 150 shares from 5 years ago … best thing I ever did financially

Oh damn bro. Cut your loss and flip that shit to calls
Found him. Knew someone was lurking here throwing their whole portfolio at Tesla puts
270p 8/18 and no i don’t have any more money I can only afford a biggie bag from Wendy’s lol
I should’ve of averaged down lol. Was buying on their month long dip… then sold for it to really take off
Shhh... Let the sky is falling sell sell sell traders have their way. I also went in heavy near the low and kept buying. That said, car sales growth has slowed dramatically. It'll be that way until the 2 new plants open. The real growth will be in their energy sector divisions. Even with many competitors, they won't catch up with demand for years.
I wish I bought in at 106. Was waiting for the wash sale. Bought a bunch back in at 138. Was mad. Still mad that I didn't buy more
I wonder how many $400 bagholders there are.
I knew it would go back up. I just didn’t think ide miss the ride back up. Some stocks are better buying and holding.
 just haters i don’t think they actually believed that. I got into a argument a couple weeks on here about the cybertruck all troll comments about 2025 and how’s it not coming lol
Shorted from $180 to $130. This stock is way overvalued but I don’t fuck with it other than macro trends. It’s a unicorn that eats out of port a potties and shits rainbows. It makes no sense at this valuation but it’s done that for years so fuck trying to value it in any kind of realistic way.
It is.
I was buying, almost doubled my position in December of last year.  Long term hold for me
Same here. I got them at 105 Euros and was annoyed because they dipped shortly to 95 as well. Not sure how bad the blowout will be though. I think holding of value shares is the key of not gambling. I see more teslas every day on the road. If some hypergreedy people don't like quarterly reports in tough times they miss the picture.
Man I fucking wish I could buy some at $50
We have been … and for „full FSD“. 🤣
Deliveries starting by EOY

My August $300c approves this message 👍🏻👍🏻🇺🇸🇺🇸
I really wouldn’t be surprised if it sinks though, the market might have already priced this one in in the crazy rally it had.  Or it moons, nobody knows.
Its totally going up tomorrow at open
I actually think the same. I see $315 before earnings because the market is not rational right now and investors will push this back to 1T company
To the 🌝
“i want it to get to $300 eow”
Which would mean that my year end SPY $500c's would be PRINTING! Also, I guess my 7/21 TSLA $300 c's would be printing too..
wait until the financial report comes out and you find out Tesla's margin is approaching 0 and see how the stock goes then
Tomorrow market will teach WSB regards and noobies for the 1,928,987,767 time  **Buy the Rumor, Sell the News**  I'm a TSLA bull myself who believe TSLA has the potential to reach $10T in 10 Years, but to predict TSLA will reach $X in the short term (either direction) because of Y is always delusional thinking
This is also true for Apple lol

Like BBBY? 🤔
Until the cult turns on the company.... Like what's happening to Disney.
"This just means it will be that much harder to beat deliveries estimates next quarter - TSLA deliveries have definitely peaked this time." - TSLA Bears, probably
not a bear but i need more hands to count the times i got burnt with calls on a underlying beating expectations.
Lol the day I bought tsla went from 170s to 120 in a month 😂… then sold at 170 sigh
This may be true but if you think tesla bulls give any fucks about this logic then you’re going to get burned.
The low guidance meant the stock didn't go up as fast because people believed the guidance. The blowout now means the stock will go up, as a lower number was priced in
They really were very fair on guidance, so I disagree in this case
Your point? Stonk is going up 20% Monday on this news.
You obviously don’t follow it
The stock got punished with weak guidance last quarter so why wouldn’t it moon on a blowout deliveries?
Didn't TSLA bears make this same argument the last time EV tax credits expired, when Tesla sales were *checks notes* about 5% of what they are today?
>LMAO. You get a blowout by giving low guidance  * Tesla doesn't give short term guidance  * That low annual increase of -- checks notes -- 80% increase in sales.
And what price are you selling or you holding till earnings?
Look at this nerd trying to make sense of this casino.   Did you get lost from /r/valueinvesting?
Look at this technical analysis BS. Get out of here with that crap lol
Ok. I want you to buy PUTS tomorrow at open. A shit ton. Then post a snapshot of all the puts you are holding.
Then there is the fact that their competition is adopting their plug and soon will be using their charging network.
buy putz and post here
I think you have good points and also they’ve stated that their goal is to deliver as many cars as possible even if their margins take a hit. Last quarter was the first where the change was noticeable and the margins should be more consistent even if slightly less than last quarter. The name of the game is getting cars in customer’s hands and Tesla has the advantage and is leaning on that which puts pressure on their competitors to meet their prices and volume numbers.
they still have room compared to legacy automakers
This should be the top comment.
They have almost equally raised prices as well.
You made a mistake in trying to understand this market. The market doesnt make sense anymore.
Once Full self driving will be legally allowed, how many TSLA owners will buy into it? Are there some numbers on that? Whenever the months of that announcement I reckon the stock will penetrate the moon so hard
What is this? Why are there numbers in this DD?
Found the TSLAQanon regard
When Elon said not to overleverage, I knew to overleverage
Good enough for me
I wish 🤣 that would be the start of the INSANE bull market like we had in 2021
Sure. It’s a $3T company. Why not? 🤦‍♂️
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)
buy tomorrow when it runs 10%.  sell at a loss when it drops after a few hours because profit taking.  regret next day when it goes back up.  \*diary of the retail investor\*
Tesla has a single product and it has barely changed in a decade.
Today people say “Remember when Amazon only sold books”. In 2030 they will be saying “Remember when Tesla only sold cars”
Tesla is basically skynet
TFW this "realllly low" estimate is still 10% growth QoQ
Now say that again without crying
Imagine thinking that Telsa „specializes“ in AI, EV, robots, when in fact, there are plenty of companies out there that do each and every one of those much better.
because it's fundamentally worthless
Wasn’t that robot a college level project at best.
Cathie literally dumped NVDA at the bottom she is a terrible investor
*lithium
I got 6 calls till July 28 265 270 calls ‼️😂
Yeah no idea how this isn't clear.  Even Musk's twitter-breaking ass admitted their crazy P/E is tied to future prospects of solving things like FSD (lol).   Selling cars is important for car companies, not tech companies.
Five years ago, it was basically Tesla or the Nissan Leaf.  Now there are dozens of EVs from almost every major brand. Most are still low volume/big money losers (I think only Kia is flirting with profitability among traditional automakers in the EV space), but competition is *here*, they just need to figure some stuff out.  Last year I was *sure* I would buy a Model S (probably still will) but since driving the Audi e-Tron GT, I have seen the first viable alternative. Worse range, but better build quality and styling, and this is just the first model year for Audi.  Tesla will have some time yet in their dominant position, but historically the first to market ends up with 20% of the market.
We shall see. Be back tomorrow
Headlines say "beat" so stock goes up.  Is it really good? Difficult to say with all these price changes, depends where the margins are now.
*put* your money where your mouth is  !remindme 1 day
Honestly I wouldn't be surprised if it went down lol. It went on a 40+% run and the longest run in history based on the news of them opening up the supercharging network last month when in reality that has very minimal impact on how they should be valued or where their focus is.  Telsa's stock price as far as I can tell moves almost completely arbitrarily to their fundamentals. Highly emotion based stock for some reason.
!RemindMe in 1 day

Unlike SpaceX
Last quarter there was some confusion on the true consensus, because of that it wasn’t a blow out in most people minds.
Consensus deliveries was 448,000 IIRC so that's not true.  Why is margin likely to suffer specifically? Doesn't margin increase as production goes up by virtue of fixed costs of running the factories?  My understanding is we've also passed the peak lithium prices coming through the bottleneck and should be on the downtrend as of a few months ago as well. Telsa this quarter to my knowledge has also been steadily raising prices over time on their vehicles. I would think we should be at least more or less flat on margin if not increasing slightly this quarter.
False information, check your numbers
That’s beans today. Aapl just hit 3T and it’s just a Chinese phone dropshipper….
YeH, ok
You holdin PUTS, huh?
Elon still fucking around on tweeter... Zach runs the business, Tom runs the factories.
You should buy PUTS. Buy a lot!
Yet you’re not holding puts so you’re not that confident
12/15? What sub am I on
I'm gambling with you as well. Sitting on around 1400 contracts for somewhere around 275. (can't recall, don't care enough to check)  Monday may pay off my house. :)
Sell now
Dammnnn thats wayyy out of the money calls, sorry to say but id sell as soon as you can
What’s you break even?
In the process of learning. So does this mean you paid 6.83 for the option to buy the stock at 420 from now till 12/15?
Could you ELI5 please? Sounds interesting.
We shall see
The glory hole is open for business
Where are the Oscar nominations?
> You think it's a magical fucking unicorn that farts rainbows.   How much should I invest in this?
I made maybe $1,500 shorting Tesla over the last year.  Not worth the anxiety.  Hard to compete with religion.  These numbers are going to pump the stock so hard that it will be hard to resist shorting again.
Why do people invest so much cheddar in a company that can barely manufacture a commodity that other companies have been making for a 100 years that literally bankrupts its owner after a minor collision?
If you don't think Tesla is a special company that deserves to have a huge implied future value  far more than any car maker than there is nothing to be said.. facts obviously don't have meaning in your world
What's overvalued? Only company on the planet with feasible self-driving software. A brand name so popular it didn't even needed advertising to become the most valued company on the planet and there are no signs of said company slowing down.   &#x200B;  Fuck rainbows, fucking unicorns, self driving alone is worth every penny.      Also how many car companies have their own gas station?      I just want to drunk and drive legally, don't be a downer man.
Facts, broski.  I’m regarded, definitely *not that* regarded. There are levels to this
>You think it's a magical fucking unicorn that farts rainbows.  Yes, but I used a conservative discount rate to calculate the present value of the future unicorn farts.

It farts charging stations.
Until you realize that fiat is actually worth nothing so 700B of nothing is still nothing hence it is massively undervalued
I think Tesla should just license the tech and software to the established car companies who actually know how to BUILD A CAR 😂. Tesla would make so much more money that way as well.
If he's holding for 3 years he had already forgotten to do that
Yeah. That’s how shares work. You don’t sell shares. You only ever buy shares.   Contracts guy. This sub is about contracts.
You mean the 10 shares you bought 5 yrs ago? ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Look at this teamwork. Love to see it 🥺
Oh man you let the lefties and bears get to you? The last dip was MSM making up fake stories to drive Elon and Tesla down after he broke their toys.
Same!!! I bought a bit $120-$130. Then forgot about it unfortunately. I sold a put around $160 and avoided assignment. 🤦‍♂️ Could have made 10k in a month
Same. Timing is really tough. I figured we were going hover around $100 for a few months.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Fair
I’ve been waiting for starship launch, o wait I did launch
Which year?
They don’t even have a street legal prototype
healthcare reform within the next 2 weeks
I mean, that’s basically how Tesla trades. It’s the crypto of stocks.
Exactly!!! 😂

This!!!
Apple has an ecosystem of products. Tesla has four cars that aren’t particularly interesting.
When you saw those ques for new iphone where people were setting up tents all the way back in 2012... you knew that Apple will go to multiple trillion valuation lol
Priced in
Apple ain’t sleeping tho.  Their chip’s performance is amazing.
I think that hype died down over the past few years , we will need another once in a lifetime set up for it to pop off
Shifting the goalposts again
Lol actually no😅 Cybertruck will start delivery q3.
You’re a good investor, but bad gambler.
Literally me
Dont tell him. Let him burn
What Tesla bulls haven’t been all in for months?
You should replace “Tesla bulls” with “earnings”. The money is what matters.
Exactly. It's not a trick really. If you give low guidance, people will interpret that as "ohh, things are looking bad" and the stock either will go down or grow much slower. If you heavily exceed those expectations, then it will grow where it would have had you originally given them. So... nothing really would change.
🤣🤣🤣
No selling calls before but keeping my shares
https://youtu.be/i6l8MFdTaPE
That's actually fundamental analysis
Given how the market likes to fuck around in the short term, this may actually be the play.
Sell the news!
So no need to buy Tesla’s then.
They slashed prices before Q2 started.  They have done small increases, but are not back to their Feb 2023 prices.
I don’t think FSD will ever be anything more than an L2 driver assistance package for a variety of technical and regulatory reasons. And regardless it will probably have a very low take rate because your average joe doesn’t have an extra $15k laying around. If the vast majority of your unit volume of 10-20M vehicles per year is $25-30k cars then you won’t be able to sell a high percentage with a nice to have like FSD. The only thing that matters in that price range is the cost for the basic utility of the car. Also, only a fraction of those cars will be sold in the US so the probability of FSD working in every country and being approved by every country’s regulatory body is very low so right off the bat that will destroy the take rate.
I don’t think Teslas will ever have true FSD. Certianly not the legacy ones. The camera-only architecture can’t do it. Others have passed Tesla already. Mercedes has L3, however limited it is, they have it. And they’ll evolve from there. Tesla is barely L2. And no, it’s not just a matter of software. Your 2023 Model X will never be upgradable to FSD. It’s just another cup of hopium Elon is pandering.
That wouldn’t be a start. That would be the fucking end.
I'm up 5M on the stock in the past decade. The only thing that doesn't change is the bear perspective. No matter how much they lose, their song stays the same.
This is why you will be poor, stop fighting it and join in.
Will not remain the only product
Yeah, solar roofs, megapack batteries, semi trucks, S 3 X Y model car and suvs. Lithium refinery. Humanoid robots(already in use in alpha state in factories) Cybertruck this year. Subscription for internet in the cars. FSD subscription $200 per month, FSD outright purchase($15k currently and rising). Supercharger stations. Dojo super computer on the horizon.     Looks like a single product to me. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|shrug)
Barely changed? They have more fully online factories, the most modern ones on the planet. Trained staff. Better product quality. Software is far more advanced where it already drives far more secure than a human. Drastically more charging stations.      Next decade you will be just crying why you didn't buy in earlier.
> Tesla has a single product  Power Walls?  I've heard they make some cars too
Remember when Twitter was only a bird app.
Tesla is basically the "U.S. Robotics" from the Asimov books, if everything goes according to the plan. The potential to sell millions, or even billions, of robots is there - it's just a question who builds them, at this point.
Unit volume growth is not earnings growth. They had massive unit volume growth in Q1 but their earnings dropped -24% YoY. Slashing prices to move volume does not make your business worth more.
10% growth is nothing at all compared to their PE
I am not short but if it gaps Monday I’m ready haha
Imagine imagining imaginations.
Who is better at making EVs ?
That is true as well.
She got lucky with Tesla early on but otherwise is a joke
ONE OF US !
I mean once all those cars have to update to get full FSD packages that will be some sweet instant cash, and the beauty is, that it is just a software update, nothing to produce or deliver
It was a fucking plug lol. I swear the only thing fueling tech rn is FOMO
It may be priced in, Tesla had a huge inventory so the started slashing prices to also move more cars. Wouldn’t be surprised if it goes up or down 10%… but yeah went long and got burned back at 170 to 120 then road back to near breakeven for this to just moon shoot lol
Recent 50% run is nothing compared to the 100% run in Jan/Feb.  (and it's done 100% 1-2 months runs in past years)  The main reason it went from $300 to $100 between Sept and Dec 2022 was insider dumping (Elon said 'buy the dip' and then repeatedly dumped billions directly on the open market and through his foundation).  The main reason it's gone from $100 to $250 in 2023 is continued execution / improving macro AND the LACK of insider dumping.

What could possibly lead to confusion, it’s estimates vs delivered. Do you have a link?
Your username is starshipmars so you're a fucking cuck and moron stfu lolllll
Dont mind him. He's mad because he's holding PUTS and will be wiped out tomorrow at open
lol deleted, his numbers were false
Apple produced 30B in net profit in Q1 compared to just 2.5B for Tesla. And Apple is maintaining their margins through challenging macro conditions. While Tesla is slashing prices continually to keep unit volume growth high while their margins compress. -24% earnings growth YoY for Tesla despite huge top line and unit volume growth. Very different businesses.
Can't argue with stupid ![img](emote|t5_2th52|31226)
Hahahahahha oh my god
Lololol. The Shein of phones and computers
No he definitely bought in the $101 bottom
Tesla is not in my investment radar. I follow some principles that leadership and management culture are things that goes top to bottom.  I don't know how Tesla could have prevented Elon complete idiocy to trickle down the ranks if he was really hands.  More and more I think he was more of a marketing tool than an administrator.
I don’t spend as much time on Wall Street bets as I did before the swarm of normies arrived, but as a result I’ve been a little less regarded with some of my plays, the degen on me would have preferred weeklies ￼

Shit… did you hit it then?
I actually don’t expect this news to move Tesla much, but I also expect Tesla to move in a way I can’t expect, so it’s a gamble I’m cool with - goal is to sell x contracts to get my principal and let however many contracts ride 2-3 months… plan b sell whatever I can get before $0.00
Nah, there’s no rush… no risk
$426.85
Each time people ask this TSLA sets another record.

I'm willing ro invest in magical farts too. What's the ticker? MFRT?
Your whole portfolio. Do it. You won’t, you coward
How does it bankrupt it's owner after a minor collision? You get insurance for damages toy our car.
They said the same about tulips, and enron, and cisco, and blackberry, and theranos...
It was a special company because if had an early mover advantage that could've allowed them to corner the EV market. Then they fucked around making a 17 cars a year for the past decade and now the big boy automanufacturers are in on EVS. Now they're just a meme stock
If you use an exclamation mark in your text, what you're saying is probably going to sound dumb. This gauge holds true all too often.
Tesla doesn’t have a self driving vehicle, so how is it the only feasible option when there are literally companies operating fully autonomous fleets of vehicles? Waymo and Crusie are both operating robotaxi’s that are generating revenue by picking up and dropping off passengers with no driver. Tesla is just a driver assist system with no viable path to full autonomy unless they decide to incorporate LiDAR which is not feasible in a consumer vehicle.
Its self-driving software is not currently feasible. The only thing supporting it's share price is the bubble. It's a feedback loop. It being worth a lot just because it's popular is great until it's not.  Once the world decides that it doesn't love the brand it will crash hard. I don't recommend shorting it because there's no way to predict when it will pop. Maybe not for many more years. But I won't recommend to anyone investing a noteworthy portion of your portfolio in it.
> Only company on the planet with feasible self-driving software  Nope. They aren't closer than anyone else in which is very far away. But they marketed their shit like they are which probably gives them a huge civil liability coming down the road. That's honestly their biggest weakness.
Isn’t it ‘valued’ at something ridiculous like more than the sum of all other car companies on the stock market?
K, but it's still 5x more worthless fiat than similarly important companies with similar earning potential.  It's valued like a tech company rather than a company that has to make physical shit with real input costs.  If you add up Tesla's profits for the next 30 years, and adjust for inflation to today's dollars, it probably won't be 700 billion.
Yes yes it did lol 😂 every time I buy the dip I always sell before it blasts off :(
Oh, now *that‘s* going to be the growth and profit driver? 🤣   SpaceX ain’t Tesla. Just FYI. But sure, genius Elon can outperform the entire car industry for years to come, while also running SpaceX, The Boring Company, Hyperloop, and Twitter (and we all know how well those are going …)
2 weeks

It’s the most regarded stock

I pinky promise (with the pinky i just stuck up some guys pooper behind the Wendy's dumpster)
Oh thats easy. If you really believe that, buy PUTS at the spike. Sell EOD
Same thing no?
And McDonald’s has a Big Mac yet that’s not particularly interesting yet they are a massive chain. You clearly know nothing about tesla lol
Four cars, semi trucks, more affordable model about to be released, cybertruck, constantly dropping costs through streamlining to gain exponential sales, EU market banning ICE vehicles so only electric can sell, megapack power storage growing by huge numbers yearly, opening up chargers and future software to other companies for a fee. Thats just for starters before you get into the Dojo, AI, space-x, FSD if/when it comes, robotaxi if it happens, the humanoid robots. Hey it may not happen but Id not bet against musk. The man consistently proves everyone wrong, maybe later than planned but always delivers eventually. Personally Ill keep holding 🤷 see where I stand in comparison to everyone who bet against the stock in a few years time..... I suspect they will have suffered catastrophic losses on shorts and Ill be more than happy with the return. Tbh I could withdraw my initial investment now and still be very happy with whatever happens 😂 I wont but I could. Give it a whirl and buy yourself a couple Tesla.... Might even be glad you did in a few years.
Lol.  Are you trolling?!  Wait.  Do you seriously know SO little about Tesla that you think… a trillion dollar company… is just… 4 cars?!  Lol. What?!  How’s that even possible?     Holy 🤡 alert!    Wow dude.    Do you also think General Electric only makes clock radios??!   😂
Tesla has Elon Musk
They didn’t start that way
Bruhh 😂😂😂
Not interesting, but fricken' available.  I wanted a Toyota Rav4 but I have to wait 2 years to get it.   Biting the bullet and checking out the Tesla SUV this weekend, which have a 2-3 week wait period.
Cope
*Masterful gambit sir!*
With TSLA, its more like buy the news. Shits strange
Yeah, that's not great news for Tesla.  Becoming a standard means everyone else can hop-in without paying you.  Every other auto maker out there has far more scale and capacity than Tesla.
Doesn't matter what redditors think it will be. The AI development skyrocketed, only a moron would deny the current progress it date processing capabilities.      And only a moron would deny the edge TSLA has in that sector.      Only thing that matters if regulations will allow for it or nowt, not what you think     Other countries will have no choice the more public demands FSD once more and more statistics of it's safety come out. People don't give a shit about regulation, the public loves safety and will vote out any politician not supporting FSD.
Like we won't get AI that can make amazing art huh? You are way behind the curve.
Congrats, it's 6M tomorrow
Good for you? I bet there’s someone out there who won the powerball who can tell you the wonders of buying lotto tickets too.
> I'm up 5M on the stock  Damn, dude!
Lol u too??

Nice, a narrative! I bet all other companies will also have future products as well..
"it's just a question who builds them"  Ummmm.... they just need to build some robots that are good enough to build the rest
🤣 The Tesla robot is a clumsy piece of hype PR. Ever been to Toyota HQ? They have a 20 year old robot there that can play the violin. When will people learn that Elon does not come up with new stuff. He‘s just really good at hyping ideas that other have had before.
> it's just a question who builds them  That's Tesla's strength - mass producing hardware  Currently Google (PALMe) and NVidia Robotics are ahead of them in robot reasoning/trainability, but Tesla will probably catch up at some point.
Except here the estimate is strictly talking about unit volume
Eating those words, up over 6%.
Do 110%^4 for the whole year and see what that gets you
let's conveniently forget about the charging standard adoption
Probably the company whose steering wheels fall off, panels are misaligned, has dogshit customer service and produces cars with a child seeking radar
Hint: they never will, shit’s impossible and regulators will smack whatever incomplete garbage they try and bring forward
Tesla fanboys are so stupid they deserve their lives of failure and ridicule
Looks like FOMO pays
I've actually bought at 244 after the downgrades ya bum
Agreed but it happened.  https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-tsla-confusing-q1-2023-analyst-consensus-explained/amp/  Baron’s as well:  https://www.barrons.com/amp/articles/tesla-deliveries-confusing-consensus-e285649a

Dude, shut the fuck up. Buy puts, all this arguing is pointless. You’ve literally said this exact same thing like  5 times on this thread alone.
Sure but I’m not comparing the technicals…. TSLA is fully backed by the FED/gov and has been for decades ask shorties..…. You have to think beyond just mere numbers. Remember the FEd can print trillions per day and direct Blackrock to do whatever it wants. Would Tesla be where it is today if not for unlimited support? Hertz bankrupt company randomly buying 50,000 Teslas????? Hmmmmmm……… I sell environmentally friendly green products last I checked my customers do not get a $7500 gov bonus….
Yes you can. I see it in the psych ward often. You can get meds for it though!
Yup exactly lol just hope they don’t shut down that production because Sri Lanka phones will be much worse.
Nah he's got that PUT energy
Congrats on graduating from the school of regards. It's a very low bar but regardless, the graduation rate is still . 1%
Ya. Looks pretty good. Last I checked I'd seen a $43k gain today. Will probably hold until after earnings call.
Oh I don’t know why I assumed you bought those calls months ago before Tesla went on it’s run. Definitely a questionable play, friend
Shorts have been exiting. Short volume is plummeting. Seems like something is happening either way.
Eh 13% over its all time high, another 60% from where its at right now, that just seems way out of reach
Good luck!
Record in what exactly? Beating their own historic numbers? Whoop-dee-doo!
Insurance will pay what insurance believes is a "reasonable" amount of money to fix your car.  It's not unusual for a Tesla to cost $40-$50 thousand to repair minor damage.
Insurance companies are for profit companies. That means if Tesla's cost a lot to fix they'll charge more to insure them.
Cherrypicking at its finest 🏳️‍🌈🐻
>now the big boy automanufacturers are in on EVs  Thanks for the laugh - you belong here. Go buy calls on Ford, GM, Toyota if they’re so great!
yeah, Ford is crushing TSLA!  &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/enhmk7vx1n9b1.png?width=1523&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e24684ded003c829078a6cee0771e67822f90b25   [Ford Loses Nearly $60,000 for Every Electric Vehicle Sold - TheStreet](https://www.thestreet.com/technology/ford-loses-nearly-60000-for-every-electric-vehicle-sold#:~:text=The%20legacy%20carmaker%20has%2C%20for,from%20those%20of%20gasoline%20cars.)
Yeah and several of the big boy auto manufacturers have signed up for their customers to use Tesla’s charging equipment.   Do you even know how to monopoly bro?!
Lol, this is seriously misinformed, Waymo and Cruze? Sheesh, they are trash, any money in Ford or GM will be lost. Without bailouts or Tesla helping them out they are toast!
Then you should be able to provide statistics I can look up with how many other companies have how many cars currently collecting data in FSD mode?
You’re straight up a fucking moron once you mention Waymo and cruise as competitors to Tesla. Do your research. And the upvotes/downvotes really show how many people have no idea.
You can say that about any company, tell me you know nothing about FSD in so many words.      The lack of real arguments against FSD speaks for itself.
Wrong, politicians are already under pressure the more kids keep dying, the harder it becomes to hide the fact that FSD is already way saver than humans.     Germany, one of the most Car corrupt country in the world is feeling the hear, because at the end of the day, the population LOVES safety. And regulators do what the politicians tell them to     Just a few more VIP deaths in cars.
No other company has FSD. That's just gonna be insane. I mean you missed the first wave of TSLA boom, go ahead and short it, TSLA only gonna get bigger now that they are out of the baby phase.      But a lot of people bet against the future here, so they will be sore losers  some more
Those similar companies are just 5x undervalued….
I started buying at $108 and not selling for a long long time 😂 see a lot of people hating on this stock but personally I think its got a long way to go still so buying and holding. Anyone who says its overvalued go short it 😉😉😉 come back to me in a couple years time see who suffers the worst financial burns/loss porn  😂😂
Besides being ugly AF, when they discovered they can't build it at scale - there was the excuse to shoot that horse and go to plan B. At least plan B would make the race before the field gets too crowded.
I thought I felt something
Mmmmmm...
McD's biggest seller are the fries.  Big Mac is #2, then Happy Meals.  McD's has more _breakfast_ products than Tesla has.
Bro that is so many words
Lol Cybertruck. Does anyone actually want Cybertruck?
> semi trucks  Don't exist  > cybertruck  Doesn't exist
This👆🤣
I am. Will you?
No it isn’t. It’s almost always sell the news
Exactly my point. We agree regulators will determine whether Tesla is allowed to have FSD as an L4 or L5 system. And Tesla hasn’t designed their system to meet basic regulatory requirements for safety critical autonomous systems.   For example, they don’t have full redundancy on all safety critical systems required for a “fail operational” fully autonomous system. Not a fail safe system but fail operational. The people actually developing L4 and L5 systems have fully redundant controls including braking and steering. They also have redundancy at a sensor level. Tesla has some redundancy but not nearly enough for anything beyond a driver assistance system. They don’t even meet the basics. There’s a reason Tesla hasn’t been approved for anything beyond L2 on even a test bed vehicle. Their cars all require a driver to be present. Meanwhile tons of other companies have vehicles being tested without safety drivers. I work in ML/CV space and worked in getting safety critical aircraft systems certified for over a decade.
One word: Fog.
Not really a yolo. I bought the stock after I bought the product and didn't listen to anyone that tried to convince me that Tesla wasn't going to change the entire market. It's going to 2K, and you don't need to believe it. Tesla is just getting started. Their ambitions are much larger than where they are today.
And I could have guessed that would be your response. Whatever you have it could be at least 5x if you bought and held in the last 10 years, same will happen again.
Me too, but it’s all unrealized
Well other companies are not Tesla. I understand the skepticism but also there are pros for the company
So what? Before Elon companies already manufactured low volume EVs with no real usability and no demand. Same applies to humanoid robots.  Japanese robotics companies never made anything remotely useful despite decades of work in the field. Boston Dynamics is impressive, yet they are not in hurry to make it a product.  But Tesla needs robots to do actual tasks, and needs them now, they dont want them playing violin or doing a backflip but replacing factory workers.  Even if they are clumsy, if they can do some job that requires a factory worker now, it is a win for Tesla. Sooner or later they will replace every mechanical job that requires humans in factories. And Musk always says the product is not the car but the factory
Right but people are missing the forest for the trees here. Degrading your profit margins by 10% and YoY earnings to move more unit volume is meaningless.
146%, meh
Bro if this is the Tesla bear case I'm feeling pretty good about my stocks.
You don't know how things work. Regulators don't matter shit. The more TSLA's are out there = the more voters will be pro TSLA. The more children keep dying in car crashes while TSLA keeps showing stats of much better survival rates. The pressure gonna keep going.      Corruption can slow progress, but never prevent it. When you said the word impossible you must know how silly you sound in the current age?
Its ok I would be mad too if I didn't make the crazy TSLA money. You are the stupid one if you now refuse to partake with easy money because you got burned and now pussy out but still post in a gambling forum.      TSLA already 6% pre market, I will see you at Wendy's
Until it doesn’t
Starshipmars username linking to teslarati. I hope to god you're getting paid to be this pathetic lmfao
100% hahaha he wishes he went long
We can gradgitate?  Will I still be regarded?
> but regardless, the graduation rate is still . 1%  graduating with a regardless degree, summa *cum* lauda is pretty hard
Haha my man! I hope you get your house paid off and don’t twat it up the wall like most in here! Alternatively gamble the lot and post the loss porn. 🤷‍♂️
Nah, haha - you are right, definitely questionable play, straight up gambling with some profits
Bro u know u can sell before expiry ye? Hes got ample time for it to bump up a bit and sell for profit
I don’t need it go up much before I take profits - if it goes up $1-5 dollars within a week or so, I’ll make money, but none of that matters bc like I said earlier it’s house money so I’m gonna let it ride until I like the profits LOL! But yeah TL;DR I don’t expect it to move up another 60%, but don’t need it to, and Tesla continues to do what I don’t expect so let’s see
Yeah, they all want to pretend like the bar isn't already so low each quarter that it's pretty much buried five and a half feet underground
Any historic comparatives for the contrary?
Toyota make great cars. The eCVT (admittedly, not electric, but hybrid) is a great thing Toyota does. Whoever says traditional car manufacturers are dead do not know what they are talking about.
Pretty sure that's a self own. No one is buying Ford, GM, Toyota because they aren't as overvalued as Tesla. They're valued where they should be. That's why Tesla is literally a meme stock. There's no reason for it to be that high.
If tesla had a monopoly, the big boys wouldn't have any customers
Adopting a standard does not make the standard inventor exceptional.  Nobody cares who invented the gasoline dispensing nozzle.
> Wrong, politicians are already under pressure the more kids keep dying, the harder it becomes to hide the fact that FSD is already way saver than humans   I mean, right now it's objectively not. It can't handle tons of road situations like construction zones.  It does lots of stupid things. Right now it's equivalent to the worst possible driver. Unfortunately problems that haven't been solved yet are hard problems. All the low hanging fruit is gone. It took three or four years to chew through the 85% we've got, but that last 15% will take another 10 or 15.
They also basically have turned themselves into a utility company with their charging network that's growing rapidly.      So AI, Self Driving, and a Charging Network that's being adopted by everyone.      It's like people who don't realize that Apple's worth is significantly tied to services which is where they've seen so much growth. People don't think of Apple as a services company and think of them as a hardware company \~ which leads to it being constantly undervalued consistently as the biggest company in the world.
The gulf between _actual_ full self driving and what Tesla calls full self driving represents years (maybe decades) of R&D
Let's just hope he doesn't die fighting Zuck
So many words because there is way more to the company than people think 🤣 but hey if you are not interested in it thats cool too sit this one out. Just this whole subreddit is dedicated to people looking for the next big investment opportunity and in my eyes this is it. Go read just what the company does. Look at the numbers, the forecast income, the different research thats being done and maybe you might see the opportunity it provides. And if you don't want to buy in 🤷🤷🤷 thats fine too. I was very late to the party myself as I wasnt wholly convinced until this January that it was all above board and worth the risk. And now very very glad I bought in when I did.
I had to double take at that. Ive never seen someone use cybertruck unironically before.
Yes.
Semi do exist..... The ones pepsi and Frito-Lay have doing deliverys in California are very real and so far saved the company a huge amount on fuel, over time tje saving on upkeep and maintenance will far outweigh the cost of a regular semi. Late yes but thats par for the course. Doesn't make them any less real. Cybertruck also late but will see what the uptake is when it lands 👌👌 1.5million pre order Ill be interested to see how it performs when it lands.
Again not regulators, but politicians. The more people keep dying the more pressure there will be. Especially as most TSLA drivers are on the influential side and the more people keep buying TSLA. It's inevitable.      You are full of shit with your claims of redundancy. Nobody here gives a shit about your credentials, even if true. This is a political issue.      The only thing I care about is that the system keeps improving rapidly.
Tesla nearly went bankrupt in 2018. Only because Musk committed securities fraud (repeatedly) and did it a lot.  >It's going to 2K  Lol, selling overpriced cars? Cool story, maybe if the USD hyper-inflates 10,000% you'll be right.
Oh, now it’s a $6T company. 🤣🤣🤣 FFS, on WHAT basis?
Why gamble when you don't have to?
> And I could have guessed that would be your response.  And yet, you said "this is why you will be poor". I'm top 1% my man, I'm not "poor" by any measure, nor will I be.
Tesla is known to have a super shitty culture.
Goddam Tesla cultists are fucking stupid.
It's meaningful when you're choking out your competition. VW just announced they're cutting EV production 30% due to poor sales.
You don't factor in stuff like TSLA earning money on TSLA charges = more TSLA's out the better     Making as many TSLA's is the most important. For how ever cheap they can get away with it until Wallstreet doesn't like it     THere is also the factor of FSD being a huge cashcow just waiting to happen. Because you can bet your ass every mom and her boyfriend are gonna turn on FSD once it's legal
not when they sell services for the life of their products
Until then...
Here is Barron’s you ass.  https://www.barrons.com/amp/articles/tesla-deliveries-confusing-consensus-e285649a

Overtly.
My gambling account sucks this year. This is in my more long-term account and all the contacts are LEAPs. I will most likely hold them along with all my shares until I can pay off the house with gains and buy some recreational property. Worst case I have to sit on things a couple years.
Update?
What?! The delivery numbers are consistently up. Math hard.
Coke. It has bubbles but the stock endured and look where it is now
Apple, Amazon, MSFT in their early growth days. All overvalued at the turn of the century and many other times as well.
The irony in your comment makes for a laugh. Ford/GM/Toyota aren’t moving precisely because no one is bullish on those stocks. Languishing growth, no real plan, perpetual catch-up… Really going places /s  Newsflash: companies with high projected growth enjoy their stocks mooning. Feel free to place puts on Nvidia or Tesla if you’re so confident everyone is wrong though 👍
Wrong.   Your comment clearly demonstrates you don’t know how to Monopoly bro.
Except all the investors that made fortunes from those nozzles dispensing gasoline from the oil companies.    I think you are having trouble wrapping your head around how Standard Oil monopolized the oil market in its day.  With a standard "can" of oil that would eventually be available for purchase everywhere as oil was needed for many things in the average persons day to day life.   Once you realize the parallels between the Super Charger network and the Standard Can of Oil, you will see what I am saying about the Monopoly.   &#x200B;  Until then I hope you told your wife that your short positions mean that you and her will be moving into her boyfriends apartment soon.
Maybe you need to inform yourself, when people can literally watch for themselves how current FSD performs some redditors opinion really is pointless     There is already talk in political circles to allow full FSD testing on all cars. NOW there is pressure to allow it, not in 10 years not in 15 years NOW.      China already plans to do it in 2025, the west will NEVER wait even a month longer than China.
Yea apple is a pretty hardcore example of services + brand recognition
Unless you have some actual arguments, I'm gonna trust the dude with the space ship company.
There is always this possibility 🤣🤣🤣 genuinely nothing will surprise me when it comes to EM doing mad shit but hey imagine the drama 😂 win or loose it will entertain me
I guess there are people who always wanted to drive a polygonal aluminum PlayStation 1 model Humvee
> Cybertruck also late  "late"  November 21, 2019 - July 3, 2023  1,320 days
Prove me wrong about redundancy. Oh right you can’t because you don’t know the basics about what we are discussing.
Wishful thinking if your grand plan is for politicians to put in safety regulators that dumb down safety requirements to fit Tesla’s undersigned system. You’ve been duped.
But they didn't and here we are. You never thought they would get here, but here we are. You don't think they will get to 2K.   Place your bets and stop arguing with strangers.
its not like our economy doesn't go tits up every couple years without taxpayers coming to the rescue. IF you don't even participate in the bubble years, you just in for dragging your balls through glass.
Gambling is risking money you can’t afford to lose, I’m not telling him to take out a second mortgage and bet it all just consider investing long term in TSLA as part of a diversified strategy. You can all do as you please.
Chill TF out man
Still doesn't make the business more valuable. Ask Toyota. 10M unit volume per year but lower margins due to the fact they sell insane volume of mass market vehicles with an average sales price of like $25k per car. Tesla is trying to transition from lower volume luxury prices to mass market. Their stated goal is 20M vehicles per year. That means their average sales price will continue to come down rapidly and their margins will continue to compress. That is the nature of high volume commodity vehicle sales.
Disagree. The profit on vehicle sales is much higher than the profit on charging that same vehicle every once in awhile at a super charger. 80-90% of EV charging is done at home. And profit margins at charging stations are super low because you’re just a middle man buying energy from the utility company for the customer. There’s a reason Tesla didn’t get into building out charging infrastructure before the Biden incentives made it more economically viable for them.
What services are they selling for the life of their products?
Keep gambling
Up about 55% today @ the top & closed up at around 33%
Don't bother, they just sad they lost money shorting TSLA.
They delivered 466k in Q2. Their market cap is 820B.  Toyota delivered 4,750,000 in Q2. Their market cap is 260B.  Their bar remains underground and the stock wildly overpriced. Not that I'm going to fuck with it anytime soon, because I'm not stupid.
You use this word monopoly a lot. I don't know what you think it means, but that's not it.
The degree of Elonstanning never ceases to amaze.  When you get your hands on the contracts, let me know, I'd love to read them.  But seriously, I'm more interested in the underlying commodities.  The raw materials.
Yeah, they absolutely can. Five minutes on YouTube will convince **anyone**  who isn't invested in Tesla that FSD is a long way from ready.  It's scary as fuck how bad it is in many common situations.  Like i said, the current version works pretty well in 85% of common situations and if you just watch that, it seems almost ready. But if you believe that is the standard you are wilfully ignorant. It can only be a choice to not know how many major gaps it has.  Even Tesla acknowledges they're only now testing level 4 self driving in a limited number of cars and nobody thinks level 5 is less than 4 years away. Most Tesla users are still on level 3 software.
https://jalopnik.com/video-shows-teslas-full-self-driving-absolutely-cannot-1849945338  My definition of full self driving includes being able to handle the weather that my region regularly sees.
Oh and lol about the space company, the guy is their mascot https://twitter.com/yoloption/status/1595213678147764224
Well 1.5 million people reserved one, at which point the pre order was closed. Some of its features such as multi charge points for tools etc are already being copied by Ford (although I don't know if you can say copy as Ford saw the run down and put it in action before the cybertruck actually was released so in my opinion the prototype inspired Ford to do it first but still its a Cybertruck feature thats wanted in utility vehicles). It does look like a monstrosity but if it comes off the line as indestructible as advertised and with all the features it was designed for then I can see the uptake being way bigger than people who don't follow tesla think. Genuinely believe many people are sleeping on a lot of the business because the media is so negative 😂😂 but hey time will tell. Its late as all hell but that is par for the course with Tesla, over deliver but always outside of the rather overly optimistic timeframe.
Proof what? That politicians decide if FSD will be allowed and not regulators?      All that needs to happen is for more accidents under human control. If redundancy is bad now it will be improved, that's how machines work.
I don't have a plan. The dude that shoots rockets into space, has a brain chip company and AI company and a company that outperformed all competition in the hardest industry sector has a plan.      I just know people, and people love safety more than freedom. And they love convenience. Combine safety + convenience...
You’re right, I didn’t because I couldn’t have expected musk to commit securities fraud and get away with it. Do you invest with that in mind?
Tesla is \~2% of S&P500 so nearly everyone is invested in Tesla. That's enough exposure.
> Gambling is risking money you can’t afford to lose  No... gambling is gambling. Risking any amount of money on chance is gambling.
Do I seem anything other than calm?  Edit: lol, blocking me?
Toyota doesn't have any services. Does Toyota have their own charging stations? FSD package to buy into? Other software upgrades?      Every extra car is also one more device on the street collecting date for FSD. Toyota is nice, but they don't offer anything new
Thank you.
Currently or in 10 years?
Exactly!
There’s no f’n way Toyota is on pace for 18 million cars this year.
TSLA is priced for their tech, not their current capacity, Toyota has nothing to offer besides what they already have. An old business model too slow to adapt to current times and that's why they struggling now.
Oh, so how would you describe the NACS collab with the Supercharger network?  Which was my point…   M-O-N-O-P-O-L-Y.    Sure, nothing is officially a monopoly until Warren and his boyfriend Charlie “invest” in it but they’ll most likely be dead before it meets the criteria of Berkshire officially minting it as a monopoly.
What exactly do you think energy is?
We must have deffirent expectatiosn for FSD, its far scarier what I see people perform on the street.      Its fair to have much higher standards for FSD, but saying its impossible to improve is just stupid, sorry. Its a software, it will only get better day by day.
Lets turn on the news come winter and see how humans perform
He can shitpost and send rockets to space. We all know that.
Yes correct, the owner is a bumbling idiot and that definitely makes the rollout of a giant indestructible metal cube on wheels (that he destroyed with one hit of a hammer during the demo) suspect.
Basic reading comprehension. “Prove me wrong about REDUNDANCY.”
Ah yes when the conversation devolves into “have blind faith in Elon because he did X, Y and Z”.
I don't subscribe to the bullshit you are reading and believing, so one of us made some money. But keep going with that narrative - I'm sure it will pay in spades someday.
Yeah bro, and it's made me a lot of money.
One issue with your statement.... He didn't commit fraud 🤷 jury found him not guilty on February 4th 2023. So he ALLEGEDLY committed fraud according to an accusation which has since been found false in court. I personally didn't start buying into the stock until I was happy all the media talk was lies and false information. I started buy the dip in January and have zero regrets or worrys. Id say personally it's the best possible investment I can make currently. But hey if you truly think its doomed by all means short it as much as you like. Although Id say that is a fast way to bankruptcy.
That’s flawed logic. The % is a direct result of the valuation. Nvidia is 2.75%. Surely, you’re not suggesting that, in real terms, a maker of graphics chips is 2.75% of the economy? And no, not nearly everyone is invested in Nvidia, even though it’s almost a full percentage point more than Tesla.
So don’t invest, problem solved
Ok I’m blocking you man, leave me alone
Servicing and charging cars is a low margin business. You can figure this out from Tesla financial statement (10-Q). For example in the latest quarter Tesla did 1.837B in Services revenue but cost of revenue was 1.702B. That means gross profit margin on services is only 7.9%. This part of the business is worthy very little. This does not make Tesla worth trillions.
You are correct, I read their Q2 report wrong and that's for Q1 and Q2, they're shooting for 9.2M delivered by year end.
LOL with the downvote even.  Energy is irrelevant without the ability to transport and store.  Aluminum, copper, steel, maybe uranium, cobalt, rare earth elements.  Without these, energy is a potential without a medium.
Like, if you didn't touch the steering wheel at all, FSD would get into a wreck within a week easily.  It just doesn't recognize certain things at all (construction being the most prominent).  It can improve but like I said, the stuff that wasn't solved yet is the hard stuff.  It will be a lot longer than you think.  People paying for FSD now will never actually get to use it.
And there's the classic goal post move. "Sure it's clearly not ready, but compared to an absolutely bottom tier human driver it's better in some specific situations!"
That machines can be upgraded requires no proof. All I see are constant updates and improvements. As one would expect out of software and machines. Only a moron would deny technological progress has a limit.      Good luck on Monday, your puts are toast. I'm done with your for today.
Actions and success ist more trustworthy than a redditor that starts his arguments with "lol"
In Tesla? Way ahead of you.
CEO of „chilling out“. 🤣🤣🤣
Which is excellent for a growth stock. This is about the future. Its scales drastically the more cars are sold, the more stations are being build, all of which benefit the manufacturer, unlike how things are for others     TSLA is leading the future of cars, not any other car company, they lost their advantage by being too corrupt and too lazy to innovate.
Great.   How about those mines, you know the ones that Tesla is now a technical partner?   Can someone please get this guy some Copium, stat!![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Goal post was investment into the future. You moved the goal post from the future to current FSD.
Redundancy is a hardware problem not a software problem. There are no over the air updates to fix hardware deficiencies. So Elon has 100% duped everyone who has been buying FSD with the promise of L4/L5 backwards compatibility.   And I’m not betting on Tesla one way or the other. Never bought a put in my life. I fully believe the phrase “markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent”. And I have long exposure on TSLA through SPY like everyone else who owns index funds.
Lol okay.
He’s clearly argumentative with everyone here, so yes I’m entitled to end his I’m 1% rant.
Lol no it doesn’t. You really don’t understand what you’re talking about. Charging rates don’t “scale” with more cars. Service fees don’t scale with more cars either. These are flat regardless of how many cars.
You are seriously making my day.  Vale is a questionable investment at best.  Meanwhile, virtually all major vehicle manufacturers are investing in mining at the same time.  Ask your wife's boyfriend to tell you about the concept of a "moat."
Your post said "no other company has FSD" which implies that Tesla does have FSD.   Tesla has a feature they call "full self driving" but dozens and dozens of videos online show that it's not *real* full self driving. Full self driving will arrive when you can hop in the back seat of your car, plug in your destination, and then lay back and fall asleep. No one is close to being able to deliver this. There is some really great driver assistance technology and Tesla's is quite good, but the gulf between that and full self driving may be as big as the gulf between ChatGPT and AGI.
Again what hardware can't be updated? You are full of shit. Just name the hardware that can't be replaced, I'm in a good mood to let you troll some more while TSLA is already printing pre market
Your level of intellect is exposed, when you start your reply with "lol no"     You really think it doesn't matter if a 100 TSLA's drive in a city that need charging stations, compared to a 10000 TSLA's driving in a city?
🌈🐻status: Confirmed.
I meant no other company is anywhere close to what TSLA has in terms of FSD. Whats the second best FSD developing company, how many cars do they have out there collecting FSD data?      TSLA is the closest to it, that's all people care about.
I literally already named it you just have poor reading comprehension. Redundant sensors. Redundant braking. Redundant steering. A few examples. I made no predictions about how Tesla would trade today so that’s irrelevant. I’m talking about degradation of the business. It’s very obvious Tesla trades based on momentum and hype in the short term you’d be blind not to see that. It’s people like you that drive it. The “greater fool theory”.
Lol no. Tesla is a middle man that buys electricity from the utility company and delivers it to the customer. The rates are the rates. The margins don’t improve drastically with more charging stations. It’s a very low margin business that’s why Tesla hasn’t pursued building out infrastructure for all EVs until now. They only got into making chargers so early adopters would buy Teslas. Biden is giving out incentives through the inflation reduction act so it makes the business more attractive. Otherwise it’s a shit business.
LOL your downvote is manna in my cabana.  Good luck with your investments.
Waymo? Cruise? Many people consider those companies to be ahead of Tesla.  It's unlikely that established carmakers are going to sell a broken, beta "self-driving" feature because they're in the business of selling cars, not keeping a stock price inflated by trying to convince people that fully automated luxury self driving cars are just around the corner.
Redundant steering/breaking? Who has that? I made a prediction and it paid off, you made no prediction, because you don't know what tf you talking about. 7% up baby.      Every popular company trades on momentum and hype, or they wouldn't be popular. I don't even need to call you a fool.      Smart people bet on their knowledge, you just troll a gambling forum but too scared or too poor to invest on your bullshit.
Yea car companies are moral like that. They would never sell cars that aren't perfect just to save a few $ right?     So what makes Waymo so good? How many cars are out there collecting data?      "Many people consider XXX" that's what people say that have 0 information to share.
Literally every company who is actually testing fully autonomous systems designed for L4 and L5 without safety drivers on US streets right now. Waymo, Cruise, Motional. Tesla doesn't do it because it's expensive and their goal is to sell cars. That's why its insanely dishonest of Elon to be selling FSD promising that it will be fully enabled on cars that don't have the hardware to make it possible. Tesla also doesn't have redundant sensors. What happens when a camera is blocked or failed? How does Tesla even know if it's failed? The entire point of redundancy is to identify and correct for failures. That's why aircraft autopilot systems have TRIPLE redundancy on all sensors (pitot tubes, gyros, etc). They also have redundancy on all controls (actuators, etc). You can't have single point of failures like Tesla does. The systems have to be "fail operational" not "fail safe".
Also, I have long exposure to Tesla like everyone else does. It's part of the index (S&P500). So a portion of my portfolio is tied Tesla performance. Duh.
Waymo? Are you being serious? How many Waymo cars are out there collecting data? ...jesus. I knew you had nothing.
That's not trading on knowledge, that's just doing nothing. Or did you think that made you sound smart? Have some pride dude.
You're missing the point entirely. This is a discussion about developing L4 and L5 systems. Not selling vehicles. Also, I suggest you educate yourself a little more about "data" for ML and stop parroting the things the hype community tells you. Read about "synthetic data" and read about the "long tail" of data distribution. You simply cannot and never will collect enough data on the "hard" cases in the data distribution. There are an infinite number of possible situations that could arise. 99.9% of the data collected isn't useful beyond a certain point because it's more of the same exact boring driving data. It's the law of diminishing returns. That's why all the autonomous systems developers use synthetic data to train their systems. Essentially they use game engines (Unity, etc) to generate useful data that captures rare situations during driving that you won't get from normal driving data. They generate millions of miles of synthetic data every day. And you can use ML to improve the realism of the generated camera and sensor data such that it reflects the real world and looks physically realistic (GANs, etc). But I realize I'm talking engineering and ML with a guy who has zero clue about either. So this is probably a lost cause.
You just said you were gambling. Now it's knowledge?
Here's a hint: you don't know anything that everyone else doesn't know already.
You can't decide on your own what we talk about, you brought those points up. I simply said there is no hardware or software issue that can't be fixed. And I have heard no argument against the still     If we can arguing around the point its gonna get boring. You must know I don't care about hypotheticals, FSD needs to only be better than humanity which it already is anyway.      You basically saying it will never be perfect, when nobody said that.
Gambling on my knowledge. Investing is always a gamble no matter what. A high chance to trade up doesn't mean its a guarantee. You can never account for what large banks do, fonds and institutions.      Lets discuss things on a slightly higher level than the most basic ok?
its publicly traded information after all
I already told you the vehicle hardware cannot be retroactively updated to enable a completely changed system compliant for L4 and L5 as Elon has promised. Well I guess it would technically be feasible but it would be stupid expensive and probably cost more than the car is worth. So you’d rather just buy a new car at that point.
FSD is not safer than humans. The data used to make that argument is insanely biased and anyone with remedial reasoning skills can see that. Also being safer than humans is not how safety critical systems are regulated or designed. How would you even know it’s safer when Tesla requires a driver to be present at all times? Tesla forces the driver to take over control seconds before anything bad happens so that argument goes right out the window immediately. They conveniently blame anything that happens after that on the driver and not the FSD system. Also who drives Tesla vehicles? Wealthy older individuals. Who causes the majority of vehicle accidents? Teenagers and people in their young 20s. They don’t drive Teslas because they don’t have money. So immediately the Tesla data has biased because it doesn’t capture the portion of population that actually causes accidents. I could keep going.
If you’re so smart why did you get caught with your pants down holding the bag on Tesla since late 2021? You held through a 75% draw down. And it’s still down 31%. Why didn’t you use your “knowledge” to take gains when it was 1.3T and buy back in at 300B? The reality is you’re just gambling on a hype stock that isn’t tied to anything other than a hope and a prayer. You have no idea where it’s going or how to even value it. I bet you can’t even do a simple DCF to figure out what Tesla should be worth at maturity. Just another schmo hoping to ride a get rich quick scheme pumping a stock with no argument for why it should be worth what it’s worth. I’m not saying money can’t be made by gambling in the short term. But if you can’t justify a stocks valuation by showing a model for the discounted profits in the long term then that’s not investing.
Just name the piece of hardware that can't be replaced. Or too expensive, at least we have some movement in the argument now.
Nothing biased about the fact that FSD doesn't drunk drive or gets tired, or careless. FSD only gets better each day it learns. Humans only get worse once they are over 40 years old and even in their prime make more mistakes than older humans with their reduce reacting timing and capacity for attention.      Once FSD handles a certain situations it will 100% of the time handle that situation nearly perfect, for the rest of time, and further close in on perfection despite far surpassing any human ability.
Long term is profitable, short term is more of a gamble. Its pretty basic stuff.  I can google what DCF would be, that doesn't require intelligence. Any idiot can do basic math. Seems like its around the 70-80's. Wow, so hard. Took 3 seconds. That's your investing strategy?   But that's absolutely a pointless number, this is about future technology, that's why TSLA is priced so high. Tech made google, facebook, apple, msfot, nvidia, amd and so on.  Understanding technology and its impact on the future is the intelligence part that requires thinking.  Using some bullshit business formula to calculate a pointless number
Best technical analysis so far
Break that neckline and you got a nice head and shoulders move there.

Recessions usually don't happen when everyone is screaming its coming. Once everyone is convinced it won't happen that's when we'll see it.
I'm buying SPY and tsla calls tomorrow so market will go down for 1 day at least
Everyone in New England is secretly a wizard
I just called Ja Rule and he said no recession this year or next
Most investors are fucking stupid and believe anything fed to them on a spoon.  Number go up = recession canceled. Everything else is just noise. Number continue to go up. Fuck the dollar. Fuck fundamental mechanics of money. Fuck me. Fuck you!
Just means MM's are gonna dump on everyone at some point in the near future once enough cash enters the market.  All we need is some sort of BS news to go along with it and we will have a recession.
Earnings recession has been rescheduled for 2024 & will be much milder than anticipated
Right in the kisser 🌈🐻
The fact everyone now expects "no recession" makes it all the more likely. Overextension caused by overoptimism, during a period of tight fiscal policy, will result in defaults and send ripples through the economy. This same "no recession" talk happened in 2008 as well.
Bears are not what they use to be
We were supposed to have a recession in 2023?
Commercial real estate defaults will be a "canary in the coal mine"...If damage there is contained bring on the bulls.
The bear is now suing the woman for an undisclosed amount.
With prices remaining at nearly all time highs with high interest rates, fuel will be added to inflation if interest rates are brought down or paused.  No crash expected. No landing expected.  🚀🚀🚀
Im scared to invest in anything at this point. Too many illogical movements.

By the definition of a bull market, we are actually in one.

Time to inverse “THE ExPerTs” puts 2025
my leasons on bear market: when stocks went up in 2011-12 after the stock crash of financial market, there were lot of people who said that its now getting long in tooth, also made about 20-25% profit from what I remember. Hearing all those news incessantly I started selling slowly and reduced my exposure, only later to realize that market kept going up because there was no market there Lehman moment until recently. I had to buy the same shares at almost 20-30% higher prices and made me look like a fool. The point I am trying to make is that when we come out of crashes there will be lot of non believers or fake news who will discourage people from participating in the market only later to realize they have missed the boat.
Broken wrist when trying to repel bears.... Seems profetic. Probably shouldn't try to fight bears
Yeah Recession happens in 2024 around the new Election. It’s the norm.   There is no Bull or Bears. There’s Market Manipulation. Bull and Bear is just names. Do you really think (beside the newbie investors who love to name themselves I am a Bull I am a Bear bla bla bla) anyway do you really think there are real wall streets veterans people who want bearish market like they sit put their money oh I bet my money on the market to be barren and doomed lmao. Of course not, they put their money to make money on the downside and make money on the topside. It’s just newbies who put their money and sit yeah I am a bear I believe in low dead market I know it is just a matter of time I will wait, or I am a bull I take chances roaaar I will drive hedge out.
The downward spirals begin soon.
Most people in general are complete regards so I wouldn't take any value out of anything "most" of any group thinks.  With that said, I wouldn't be surprised if Q4 2023 / Q1 2024 we realise the brunt of the looming recession in markets.

What do you call last year? By all measures that was a pretty deep haircut in line with other recessions throughout economic history.
By *every* metric we are in a bull market
Well Flordia will see the first collapse because who's gonna be picking the crops they getting rid of all their workers..
I disagree.  We are currently in a recession, but it is a mild one so far.  Foreclosures have gone up, there was an article yesterday that discussed the numbers nationwide.  The federal reserve bank issues a report about two weeks ago, that said one third of the companies in the US are on the verge of bankruptcy.  The federal reserve bank also stated that they may do one more interest rate hike later this year.  In addition, the federal reserve bank noted that there is less cash in circulation right now.  Less cash in circulation means the banks don't have as much money to lend.  And on top of all this, the rate of investors abandoning commercial real estate loans and allowing the banks to foreclosure on commercial real estate has gone way up.  All of this spells recession.  Just how deep the recession goes and for how long is yet to be determined.

Sir this is WSB. Stop saying truth bombs
Yeah because the people in the know or who think they are in the know want to imply everything is gloom and doom so they can bet against retail investors. Meanwhile, they gloat it being a "great time to buy" right before bigtime market collapses like in 2008 or the impending doom related to COVID in Jan./Feb. 2020 which we later found out was pretty much exactly when these guys were shorting the market.
I disagree. Most recessions are self fulfilling. Everyone talks about it and starts changing their spending habits and "tightening their belts" so to speak. All of that reduction causes an actual recession.  This time it seems there's not enough people "screaming a recession is coming" as spending habits haven't seemed to change despite massive inflation. Sure, we all read about it and talk about it here, but WSB doesn't represent the average American.
Ok, hear me out... ...how about... ...everyone continues to scream its coming? no more recessions ... ever!   Is this what @Cassandra has been doing all this time? the hero we need but dont deserve?
Economists have correctly predicted 25 of the last 5 recessions.
This 100%. And there’s good reason- when people are worried about a looming recession they take fewer risks, cut back hiring, reduce spending. That makes the impact of what is feared far less. It’s when people are exhibiting the greatest confidence about the economy that they are the least prepared. They don’t have savings, they’re levered to the max and they disregard trouble once it begins because they are so confident.  The greatest single indicator to me for assessing sentiment about the economy is new housing starts because it shows builders sentiment. For the last couple of years they’ve been very flat despite all the talk about exuberance and excessive risks. Last month was the first significant uptick which isn’t that surprising given that the idea of a soft or no landing has started to take hold. So it could be the very early stages of a market that is going to heat up to dangerous levels of sentiment over the next few years but we aren’t there yet or even close.
Or maybe when Putin starts using nukes in Ukraine  this fall because he can’t beat them using conventional warfare then it’s time for the market to fall off a cliff

 There will be a recession but the market won’t care 😂
I think it has more to do with the major players seeing major warning signs behind the scenes but not wanting to spook the market and/or trying to make a killing by shorting it. They seem to have way less of a problem scaring people into thinking a recession will happen any day now so they can take advantage of the panic amongst retail investors when the market is actually more stable but maybe less so when it's more of a reality so they don't get caught up in it as well (though that doesn't always work out for them).
Yep, in 2007-2008 you'd get laughed at for saying it was a bubble or that we are likely to enter a recession
Feels like we’re in the 2006 of the 2008 era, huh.
“Markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.” it's designed to fool people, especially to deter them from investing, sell at bottoms, FOMO, lose money. That's why investing, not WSB YOLO Dojo, is more automated and long term. Red days and bear markets are blessings to buy more.
The logical movement is ⬆️
Go inverse yourself!
Sorry I thought this was a MCD parking lot
So it wont happen because everyone thinks otherwise
No… facts are facts. Chain stores our closing branches, credit is pulling back, banks have reduced lending, and the scariest part is the FHA has approved sub prime housing loans again. Eventually reality comes crashing down. This is exactly what happened in 08. I had friends tapping into their home equity to by cars.
This isnt a matter of opinion. You can actually look it up. It depends on the recession type. But non-event/non supply shock caused recessions are usually unforeseen. Covid recession was foreseen bc something happened and we new what the result would be. 2008 and 1929 were largely unforeseen
I think it’s because the fed printer is still on, and people still have money to spend
Don't drink the Kool-aid Ukraine isn't doing nearly as well as the talking heads want you to believe. They've already essentially annexed all of east ukarine. But NATO being forced to get directly involved for whatever reason is definitely a black swan I'm looking out for.

I always hated that quote
uhhhh...
We are breaking the matrix
I wasn't alive in 1929, but I was in 2008 and anyone who was paying attention knew that housing prices were not sustainable. Houses were selling for double what they were going for a few years before and interest rates were relatively high compared to most of the time since then.  The credit default swap situation wasn't really public, so other than Michael Burry and handful of others, nobody really knew the extent and how bad it would be.  But you knew it was coming.    if you took out a home equity loan in the last 4 years because your house has doubled in value, you're not gonna have a good time...
I mean 2008, in retrospect was bound to happen, but it was a surprise none the less
Yeah or a US backed false flag operation here in the US could escalate this into WW3

Pretty sure he was saying "I'm Audi", 90s slang for "I'm out of here" (Audi = outtie), popularised by Clueless and Reality Bites ("I'm Audi 5000"). A phrase which LL Cool J claimed to have came up with after purchasing an Audi 5000 in the 80s, according to his book "I Make My Own Rules”.  Fuck y'all if you doubt me.

"You knew it was coming"   bro, a recession is always coming, the important part is when. That is the surprise.

What sets Tesla apart isn’t the cars themselves but the charging infrastructure and batteries.  Everyone is behind on Tesla on both of these and are right now trying to catch up.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|27189)
I like the stock
My brain is so broken on TSLA420 i initially thought this was a ber post and was getting ready to tell you to burn in hell.   What's extra dope is i am pretty heavy in LEAPS and didn't recognize 350 would be uppies.
Stfu
Tesla to 10000 minimum in the next 2 weeks! 😀😀🚀🚀🚀
*$420
I don't know what you all have with the charging infrastructure: In good 'ol Europoor you basically can charge every EV everywhere (expect Tesla's superchargers are still exclusive to Teslas, but it's no biggie: There are more than enough alternatives).
Remember when Tesla was considered a data company? Now that people realize you can't build a half-decent self driving car with only cameras, people are hyping Tesla for their charging infrastructure.
They are also behind on the cars.  Some of the other players are starting to look into gigacasting, but are far behind.  VW and can build an EV in 30 hours.  Tesla does it in 10 hours.
The software.....  Their software prowess is their biggest moat.  Everything related to software...  Software is the most important thing in these cars and its not even close (I include data collection enabled by software here). Every other company, especially legacy auto, has 4th rate software engineers.  Its going to be impossible for a car company to transition into a software-first tech company (good luck Farley...but kudos for admitting that you need to).  Its also going to be impossible to acquire the talent needed to make this transition.  High-tech starts software engineers (out of college) at 150k with stock options.  It's a different world and culture out in silicon valley.

Is that true in all of Europe or just Western Europe? The USA is huge and implementing consistent charging stations is a bit hard when I Texas is bigger than like every EU country lol.
If you rly think none of the current valuation is from FSD progress ur dreaming💀 I look forward to revisiting this comment in a few years, probably 2025 at the latest to see if ur still alive and ask u why u missed out in the best stock of our time… FSD is a pure profit maker like nothing that currently exists, and yes it can be done with current hardware🤡
Completely agree. The dashboard and sound system, it’s a whole unique experience
Lol, TSLA fanbois are great. You guys are always good for a laugh
Let's say most of it. I'm from Germany and use the app of an utility company (EnBW). They somehow managed that their app is able to communicate with basically every charging station there is (except Tesla ofc) no matter the provider.  https://preview.redd.it/9j9zp549sv9b1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3f4f470e993360dd45baf758ddf2c4b898c2ca27  Looks like this to give you some sort of impression.
2025? I thought FSD will be available in 2019! Wait, hold on it was 2020, no 2021..... If you ever think that the current hardware (i.e. cameras alone without lidar) will be enough for a fully autonomous car under all conditions you're crazy. I wanna see you put your life at risk by assuming it's safe with the current hardware. But no, all of this talk is to simply keep pumping the stock price to unrealistic levels. No way a car company is worth anywhere close to 1T dollars.
Tesla fanboy?  No.  I'm a silicon valley software engineer and previously issued electrical engineering patents on behalf of the patent office for 10 years.  Whats your cred?  Losing money?  Delivering door dash?  Keep laughing while I make money :)
Oh wow. So you combined creepy stalker with Tesla fanboi. Lol.  Something tells me the result is something close to incel
shouldn't you be playing options with your 4 dollars an hr?  Tell me Mr. Doordasher,  who has the best software engineers?
Maybe we should poll the victims of the emergency vehicles that Tesla likes to crash into ? See what they think. How many female stalking victims do you have under your belt ?
Uh huh...So you didn't answer the question...Shocker considering you're a doordasher trying to have an opinion on tech... Very cute.    I have a wife thanks.  She is a pain management attending physician.  Maybe if you put the mindless effort you put into door dashing into something worthwhile, you could score a half-decent woman yourself.
Yes, the way you stalked every post I've ever made indicates you are a highly educated person. 😆 🤣 😂  Who is very busy with important high paying work. And not at all a bitter creepy fraud.  Who is too dense to put 2+2 together about the Teslas crashing into emergency vehicles.  And it's very clearly implied judgment on the quality of Tesla software.
Lol,  do you know what day it is today?  Its the 4th of July. You see junior,  if you got a decent job, you would be paid to stay home today...Unlike you,  desperate for work, but won't make any bc people will be at a bbq.  Aww,  thats great.  You can read a random headline and suddenly you're a tech expert.  Great,  now go and apply this knowledge to your option plays.  LOL.
To dense to realize I'm at home typing this I guess. Lol
dude,  read my comment again...  Another example the stupid, not realizing they are stupid, and thinking they are smart.   Its all fine and good, but you're losing money with it.  Now.... If you read my comment really slowly....  Yes,  I know you're at home...You know why?  Its because nobody will use door dash today.....  So while someone with a decent job gets vacation pay,  you're out of 5 dollars an hr.  I upvoted you... Its my tip to you.  Go into a corner and be happy.
There is so much bitterness for such a highly successful Silicon Valley software engineer with a doctor wife. I totally believe you, bro. Lol.  You aren't a creepy basement dwelling stalker incel at all. I'm sure all those TSLA is a software, power generating, AI, chip making fanbois totally believe your credentials. TDLA go moon right ? Lol
bitterness equates to laughing at your stupidity?  Color me bitter LOL.    Here is the kicker.... Even if I were a basement dwelling incel who invested in tesla, I would be rich LOL.  You really got me man...You got me and all the other basement loser TSLA investors who invested blindly,  but still have made 700% in just the last 4 years LOL.    How are you doing with your investments?  hopefully they can help yiu survive your slow days.
based on my regarded analysis you have a 75%-80% of making monies, prolly  &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/t88y44ries9b1.png?width=1289&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=68356f9562a0116fe492d7253e37c6ad1d86af88
Nicely done.
Holy shit serious balls
i support it.
Trying to understand your post, you bought 400+ contracts (puts) betting the stock will fall below $99 and to make any money off it it'll have to go below $97.90 correct?
NUTS but I love it
How many times has it hit the $99.50/$100 and been rejected this year so far? Cuz damn I’d be terrified 😂😂
RemindMe! 24 hours
I hope this trade works out for you OP, but I just would have a difficult time going short Raytheon. I understand the range pattern, but you got more balls than me. I got some LMT calls that expire in September. Good luck sir
As we start to ramp up the military industrial complex again and the fact they either 1 have aliens or two more likely are working on some pretty intense fucking tech even as a bear I think this is a dumb play…
You’ve got balls
Thank god the Banana man agrees with me I will be Rich!!!
I care🥺
This the higher end of the stocks trading range.
Not till it is sold wednesday
Sort of. If the stock falls below 97.90 ptior to July 14, I will be able to make money by excessing the contract.  The other way to make money is if the stock goes to 98.05 tomorrow and some one else is willing to buy my position for say $1.50.   For big companies it is reasonable assume you always can get a buyer. So if the stock moves 0.5% you can make 50%. Vice versa.   However, 400-600 contracts is really the max you should assume you can always find a buyer or seller. It sometimes will take me 10-15 minutes to get out of a position and this is a 140 billion company.   These contracts have 2 big values price and time. The closer you are to the end day the lower the value for time. The farther out the higher the value. That is called Theta. And it always goes down.   I am not the smartest poster here. So ask others.
Yea i am bullish on this company but it trades in an obvious range so… buy at 95 sell at 99
Never for more than 2 weeks thats why I bought 7-14 puts. That is also why I have an order to sell to at around 1.70 ish. I will not hold out for the price to go to 96.   I am worried about it going to 104 again and staying there for a few days. Then only coming down to 98.50 on the last day of my option or the following Monday lol.   It is obvious that someone is selling at around 100.
Like 7-9 times depending how you count a test

Yea i am long term bullish on this company. But that $100 cap has held for a wile.   I feel calls and puts should be short term 3 weeks max. Anything else just buy shares.
Its totally a pattern play if i was a long term investor i would buy the stock.   Every time the stock hits 99-100 it falls a bit within 2 weeks. I bought calls at 94-95
Holding calls or puts over a holiday sucks
Mmm gotcha. Haha not my self either but learning. So if you stay with your puts hoping it goes to 97.90 you're risking for a higher profit. Selling at 1.50 you get the difference  since you bought it at 1.12?  Doing that you get a profit, not high but a gain at least and no risk afterwards since now someone else is assuming the put risk. That about right?
Yeah, long as u got that stop loss best of luck to you, My calls on mara didn’t do profit until 1 day before expiration and by then I sold so that was just a waste of time lol
I didn’t see the short date tbh
Hey man,how do you sleep at night? I always follow your post, and you always buy short expiration options worth half year’s salary. I play options with 1/10 of yours, and i still can’t sleep properly every night. Does this ruin your life? You must be glued to your phone every mins. How do you handle the ups and downs? Are you mentally prepared if you lose it all?
Yea once i sell my profits are locked in. If I cant find a buyer then I have to exercise the option to sell at 99. Meaning I have to buy at like on the market 96 and sell to the contract holder.   Right now the Theta is $1, 2 weeks out the last day the theta value will be .5 cents or nothing.
It is really hard. My lifestyle is all about Ramen and working at carmax on weekends. For fun I read books. I am also super active on r/litpg. The Carmax job helps keep me busy. I post on breaks. Then go back to filing notarizing. And at 10 pm I am exhausted. So i sleep. These trades help me wake up. At 6 am California time.
What you are experiencing is the emotional impact of stock trading. I catch myself feeling all sorts of ways when I’m down just a little for the day not to mention losing sleep over it. I’ve never seen green so I’ll let you know how that feels if it ever happens. My advice is to trade small amounts and work your way up as you are able to stomach it. This ain’t for everyone. And it sure isn’t worth losing all your sleep over it
LOL This is why I play at the Casino hahaha. So much to learn and math and analyze in your head. I play Baccarat and you just choose one side or the other. Up 3K from 1K over all visits as I keep track. Appreciate the insight, interested in learning more and hope it works out for ya!
It's been priced in for 20 years
Probably not, there’s guys that have been working with him for years now. The transition will most likely be seamless.  It’s a very bad model if it only takes one person to leave to ruin it.
Rome wasn't destroyed in a day. I would buy the dip if it happens.
I will buy the dip if it dips
Nah they have no succession plan in place. They’re expecting him to live forever and will be completely blindsided by his passing.
Temporary dip but won’t last the week
Berkshire Pasdaway is the invert etf
They already created a ChatGPT version of him as an AI that will live forever to run the company
Listen/watch the annual meeting - while Warren and Charlie are heavily involved still - they have a great team who run the various businesses as well as the investment side.  I doubt it would be material because you know it’s coming at some point and they have talked about it for a long time.
When it happens -hopefully in a very long time- it will be the one of the most obvious dip buys ever.  But yes, I'd expect the market to overreact as usual.
If buffet would have died in 1981 it would have effected Berkshire greatly. Now he himself says he has lived was past his expectancy. It’s priced in and the transition has been planned for well over a decade or two.
Nah buffet will come out telling everyone he's immortal like vandal savage
Charlie munger would probably take over if buffet dropped tomorrow.  Idk what it means for Berkshire Hathaway.  All I know is buffet says very publicly he would tell his next of kin to invest in a low cost sp500 or total market index fund. Which is what I already do
You should only buy BRK.B if you're okay with owning it after Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger are no longer with us.  The price that you pay for the shares matters A LOT so patience is important.  In almost 40 years of watching Warren and Berkshire Hathaway, there have been multiple times when the price temporarily dropped by 50%.  Not fun when it happens, especially when it happens to you for the first time.  Because of the quality of BRK's balance sheet and wholly-owned operating companies, the price recovers quickly.  I expect to hold my BRK.A and BRK.B until I die.  Right now, when Warren passes away, his son Howard becomes the non-executive chairman of the board of directors and Greg Abel moves up to become CEO.  I've been waiting for the inevitable event since the beginning of this century.  I saw him this past May and he looked twice as strong as he did last year and stronger than when I saw him in 2019.
A lot of you can't spell Warren Buffett's name correctly, and it shows.
Warren buffet is just going to upload into a new vessel
He set it up to run itself a long time ago.   Core business is good.   Real question is, will investors panic or just shrug it off, but the actual business models of the multiple businesses Berkshire operates have little to do with the old geezer.
Berkshire Hathaway is a company that does not solely depend on warren buffet anymore
Probably a big algo reaction selloff that will get quickly bought up
There's gonna be a fake dip then it will go back up. Warren has addressed this question a few times over the years. There's a lot of buyers waiting for this fake dip that's for sure.
No worries, guys! Warren Buffet's immortality potion is almost ready! 😄
What happened with Apple after Steve Jobs' death?
Sir, this is a casino.
It’s funny to see this posted. About 15 years ago I started watching the stock market very closely and have the exact same thought at that time I even considered buying puts five years out… So glad I didn’t but yes he has predecessors.
My man lives on a diet of nothing but pure of dog shit. As someone said this was priced in years ago. Usually you don’t see people with that body lasting this long.
Money saved Magic Johnson from AIDS, surely all Buffet’s money will keep him going for another century
I think yes. In the movie Lord of the Rings, when sauron was defeated, all his buildings also collapsed. Same with the bad guy in the second guardians of the galaxy movie.  Everyone is considering it to be priced in because they think everyone else has priced it in, but when it really happens it will be like Saurons death.
Charlie Munger will be taking over after Buffet, no worries.
Charlie munger can run it just fine.
Charlie will just take over for another 20 years
Almost no one is buying Berkshire to invest in Berkshire. They’re investing in it to buy Buffett and Munger. You see some of the bets made by the younger guys (snowflake) vs the Buffett method and you can already see it won’t be the same. His death isn’t priced in. Just because there IS a succession plan, doesn’t mean the loss of the key man is irrelevant m
It will be like the show succession. The father is a genius but the kids are dumb as shit.
Uncle Warren is imortal. Don't worry!
Nope they have never considered this. The death might trigger an immediate delisting
Your only options were BRK.B or SPY?
Hello.
look at the other people that are behind him. watch some interviews. if you think the structure will hold after a death it should be fine. but it surely investing in a investment company isn’t meaning that is still diversified. that would be a wrong idea about it, like investing in Robin Hood and thinking you are now diversified because they work with crypto and stuff ;)
I wouldn’t consider this a worry. Buffet has been saying for years that there’s a whole plan in place and that he could pass any time and the team would immediately know the predetermined steps to take.
Nothing is guaranteed in either investing or life (except death and taxes!).  My opinion...invest in BRK-b with a steady monthly purchase, dont put everything into 1 stock....and for gods sake, dont put anything into puts or calls, (unless you have had plenty of experience, and willing to post your extremely huge loss porn here!!) because you will be able to lose more than what you invested in.  if you buy the stock you like, even then you just lose the money you put in, not every penny times twenty!  NFA (not Financial Advice)
People thought this about Apple and Steve Jobs
People thought that about Apple and Steve Jobs, all went well. Usually these type of companies work on a succession plan long before they need it. It might however be a good buying opportunity when that sad news hits and the stock might go down for a while (I think this also happened with Apple until Tim Cook was seen as a good replacement). 🤔
It'll probably drop a bit once news of his death comes out publicly, but it'll shoot right back up within a week. I used to hold Berkshire B shares for a while. Buffet has a whole plan lined up for how to manage the firm after he passes.
Warren Buffet died 3 years ago. Everything we see is a deepfake powered by AI. They invented AI to keep the fund afloat.  Calls on NVDA.
Did this apply to Steve Apple?
It will drop that day but it will recover easy
No
This isn't a new idea. It will likly trade down for a while once the news hits but the fund will most likely do fine. There's no way there isn't someone in place to take over and its not like he doesn't already have a group of investors under him already.  If anything the fund may actually preform higher as its suspected the reason berkshire has been so risk adverse is because Warren doesn't want to damage his legacy before he dies.
I believe the people that work there have been there forever. He keeps a lot of continuity in his company and he has a pretty small staff. I don’t see his death as having a major long term Effect on the price.
Buffett dies. Market overreacts, stock drops 5%. Buy calls. Stock goes back to where it was. Profit.
Ban
I thought he died wtf bro
Only if Warren starts giving investment advice from beyond the grave! 💀📈
He’s been preparing his company for this for decades now. I’m sure there will be a short term drop, but he has a strong management/succession team that will be able to handle the load once he and Charlie have departed us. I kind of expect them to start paying a dividend at that point since I assume they won’t have anyone stock picking on the scale buffet was.
That title really got me thinking Warren Buffet was 6 feet under
this mofo so eager to short BKH he is already writing Buffet's eulogy.
516,227.53 USD for 1 share LOL
Buy that Dip
I've been draining fetuses for the last 10 years, I'm good to go until at least 105
As long as they stick to the WWWBD investment philosophy they will be fine
Don’t you know?  He’s Benjamin Buffett…  https://preview.redd.it/l5a9cdgqhr9b1.jpeg?width=963&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=082e14cd5f143e15864e5f902a553e4462430f4c
It might dip slightly on the headline news of his death, and who knows for sure, but if anyone has had plenty of time to get successors spun up and ready to take over as seamlessly as possible (besides a Ray Dalio) it would be someone like Buffet.
He died 20 years ago, but his clone has done just fine.
Too late to hop on that train. Maybe when it was 30k years ago you had a chance, but it’s too late for any gains anymore. You buying .0000001 of a share or something? Is it going to really dip 50,000 dollars? 100,000? Cmon man, there’s better fish to reel.
Consider $AAPL after Jobs death
They have fortified that company against anyone’s death. Price won’t budge.
It’s priced in.   It will drop like a stone for a day because AI will prey on the retail investors.   Then it will ROCKET because the conservative aspect of his style will be less of an influence.   Volatility will go way up and make it more trade able.
Buffet was devoured by the Munger Lizard years ago.   Buying BRK is buying AI.
No, because he’ll be replaced with AI Warren Buffet, and it will be as if nothing changed.
He's had a succession plan in place for decades. He only manages the money that comes into Berkshire, while the old owners of the businesses run the day to day operations. Hell, he even has two younger money managers that have taken some of the money from Buffett to manage.   The stock will drop because people are reactionary but over time with a younger person managing the money they should do better than the last decade since Warren isn't as energetic as he once was and never understood tech.
Warren buffett's death would affect the entire market the entire world market is the greatest investor of all time so of course it would affect Berkshire Hathaway
Someone else good will take over although it will likely drop right after the news I trust their management and will likely buy more then if BRK.A proceeds to drop then. Haven’t regretted buying it as of now.
No because Anne Hathaway will take over and take it to the MOON.
Look up track records of Ted Weschler or Todd Combs, think Brk is in great hands…
Warren Buffet = Berkshire. Or at least in a lot of people’s minds. So yes, it will cause a drop if only temporarily.
At first glance, I thought this post was saying he already died and my stomach sank a little bit
My understanding is BRKB would increase as the likelihood of spinoffs would be enhanced thereby creating more value.  Munger > Buffett.  The people running things now are most certainly very decent.
Buffet found the secret to immortality. He’ll outlive everyone.
People shit themselves when Steve Jobs died and look where Apple is under Tim Cook’s leadership.
Buffet hasn’t had ANYTHING to do with day to day operations of  Berkshire in almost two decades, his successor is already been named and running the day to day… It might tank the day he dies but will bounce back in few months.
No worries, Warren Buffet is immortal! 🚀
I will surely do. This giant tycoon is the goat in his industry
Lol.  Are you really asking for investment advice about either investing in SPY or Berkshire Hathaway on Wallstreet Bets?  Do you understand where you are?  These degenerates are one bad options trade away from a Wendy's dumpster and getting butt fucked by raccoons. Be very careful with the advice you receive here, lol.
Buffett is not running the operations which generates $30B+ annually in operating profits.  He does to a lot of equity purchases and has the ability to make deals happen quickly.  So the question is, do you value Berkshire as an industrial conglomerate or a public hedge fund?
Munger has been the brains behind it for a long time. He his no spring chicken either though...
Worry if Buffett AND Charlie Munger die.
Hopefully you’re investing in VOO and not SPY.
The reasons why Munger and Buffet drink coke all the time its to hide the half a gallon of immortality drink they have to drink everyday.
Everyone should have BRK-B shares just to attend the annual meeting — it’s pretty amazing.
Major companies don’t do any succession planning and just fall apart….wrong, they’ll be fine.  I would say there is no control over what his heirs do with his pie, but they would likely divest over time for taxes or distribs etc
Stock will skyrocket after OGB kicks it. He's basically hoarding cash like a dragon at this point.
are you seriously asking for a long-term holding choice in WSB?   No. His death will not matter that much because ~~BRK will finally get divvies~~ he will then be a put-selling AI and value stock dumpster diver.
I think when this happens it may affect the stock price short-term (it will be big news/some panic/short-termers getting out ect) but BRK probably attracts more long-term investors who trust the system that warren and charlie have put in place  than most stocks and it will continue to be a fine long-term investment.  I plan on holding it because I believe Buffet and Munger have built something purposely designed to outlive them.
I heard that the man with a pigs heart died soon after that.
They have been bringing it up at the past 25 annual meetings. Succession at BRK is probably better than the US presidential designated survivor plan….
If you have to ask the question then you already have a understanding of how things work and how they can be affected. There will never be another person like Warren Buffet.
Only if Charlie Munger goes all in on Bitcoin
Warren Buffet will Berber die.
Apple didn’t go down after Steve Jobs died.
I'll be buying the dip when he passes away. Conglomerate runs itself and prints billions in FCF. With rates where they are, they have zero pressure to buy companies when govies yield 5%. This will make for better stock picking in their future.
Buy the rumor, sell the recession
Warren Buffett always tells people close to him that when he dies you should grab the chance to load up on BRK
You are pretty much asking does Berkshire Hathaway expose to key person risk. And the answer is probably not because the company's profitability is not heavily tied to Buffett and Munger. Even with a complete incompetent successor it will probably take at least 5-10 years before it start falling.
Why y’all worried about Warren? Charlie Munger is 99
I guarantee the stock would will drop, with his passing.
No. Buffet is not irresponsible to leave what he built behind to be destroyed.  He's adopting measures to avoid what everyone sees may be a detriment to shareholders. There's talk of his son being involved as well as the board of directors adopting measures to continue Bershhire with Warren's standards of putting shareholders first, maximizing gain while minimizing risk. Always.
Buy them the day he dies.
Nope his death will not move the market
Ajit Jain is going to lever the living fuck out of Berkshire when he gets the hot seat. Expect to see it rocket ship 10x before GUHing harder than anything in recorded history, taking the rest of capitalist society with it
People thought the same thing when Steve Jobs passed away. But Apple is still doing great
Yes it will, but they've already published a succession plan so it shouldn't as much as it will
Yes it will, it was the genius other are just his lick ass
Be very afraid! After Steve Jobs died, Apple died too! …oh wait…it didn’t.
No, when Warren Buffet dies his firm will be closed and all the assets are gone.
No one lives forever, no one. But with advances in modern science and his high level income, it's not crazy to think he can live to be 245, maybe 300.
It should be, but I’m sure there will still be some sort of a dip on the news. Possibly a good buying opportunity.
Yeah I was going to say “warren buffet will die?”
Idk man. Some of these ppl think he's going to live to 107
What do you mean by that? Just curious.
its like priced in but not really priced in.  You can mentally orepare yourself for the death of your parents all you want.  When they finally do drop, you still cry.  Same thing
Right? There's this great replacement named Charlie Munger that nobody is speaking of.  Young hot shot ready to take the reins. Berkshire will be fine.
Some companies get ruined by one person taking over it.
Warren himself has talked about this in interviews. The company is almost setup to plan for his death and have a very smooth transition with some of the worlds most experienced investors continuing to manage the company in much the same way. Warren’s slow and steady careful growth over time investments in high quality companies will continue. Warren joked that his own death may be a good opportunity to get cheaper Berkshire stock 😂
If I recall correctly Buffet didn't want to invest in Apple but his staff convinced him otherwise. So his staff seems to make good calls.
It’s called “key man risk” and its extremely common in the investment industry.
Did you see Tesla price tank while Musk was busy fucking around with Twitter?
The way I see it is the value of the sum of companies is more than the value of BRK. Even if they mess up they can just split the whole thing appart and shareholders will  be ok.
The real issue is he's gifting his shares to non profits who will sell them over a 12yr timeline. Forced selling of his shares for a decade probably isn't great for the price.
>It’s a very bad model if it only takes one person to leave to ruin it.  DISNEY
How long did it take for Rome to collapse ?
>Rome wasn't **built** in a day.  FTFY
what if it never gets back up?
hell, he is a vampire and will live forever. or just call him back with a seance, plus he can tell the future by then. bullish !
lol
Just because buffet say something doesn’t means he’s right
Will his hate be everlasting?
Charlie Munger is older than Buffett.
Rip
He's just immortal like Deadpool or vandal savage 😂.hell be here long enough to see humans being slave for large corporations that sent huge dividend paycheck
🤡🤡🤡
No wonder Elon had a fit when RoboBuffet chose not to invest in tesla
Yolo shorts on both and buy a couple of houses immediately.  The houses always win
Heck, I just read in the newspaper that they put a pig heart in some guy from Russia. Do you know what that means?
Easy. Young Charlie will take over when he dies.
Nice, can't wait until I retire after at least 200 years of working.
Just in time for Jesus to come again and give the dude eternal life.
He drinks coke everyday he will live forever
Brk B to 1000$ when he reaches 100yr old.
The House always wins.
Ahahhahahahhahah
The only place where you can post such a thing and haven’t been downvoted to death.. that alone makes me buy PUTS
I heard moderna vaccine makes you live longer
Dudes in the bible lived to hundreds of years. Buffett will as well. Why do you think he is loading up on all this coke and blood boys?
So what you’re saying is despite looking like it’s overvalued and ready for a crash, warren buffet’s lifespan might keep going up? Calls it is
He won’t be there in the next 5 years
Tell that to Queen Elizabeth the second.
I’m all jacked up on Mountain Dew!
Hell maybe 350. 500. 800. Why not 1000? 2000? 5 billion? My god!  He would outlive the Earth itself.
I'm sure Buffett has enough cash on hand to buy-buy-buy on his death. He'll probably tell the CIO to sell puts when he's feeling ill, then buy calls when Buffett dies, then buy back 10% of the stock.
The A shares are so expensive, nobody is playing the market with them. That sort of insures stability
He's super old. It's a surprise to nobody in the market that he might suddenly die, except for, apparently, you.
Your post was very likely one of the very first posts about stocks ever made on the internet.  Think about that. Warren really got famous in his older years, basically in the 1980's, by the early 90's there was already the people saying "he's 60, how long will he keep going?" as a threat to Berkshire.  Most importantly ask yourself this, do you think the most risk astute investor of all time, would not  consider and plan for the most inevitable and monumental risk that his company, his life's work, his "measuring stick" will ever face? Warren and Charlie will be gone one day, we all know that, most of all Warren and Charlie.
Learn about assets.
I was getting ready to tell you that you sound like an idiot until you said “young hotshot”. Kid isn’t a day over 16. I’d be a little worried about his maturity and lack of life experience, but he’ll grow into the role for sure
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|27189)
let that sink in
Warren has been so far removed from most of the entities of Berkshire Hathaway it’s probably not going to be noticeable. He had guys he’s hand selected as presidents of his companies, and there’s people under them that have been groomed over decades to replace them.   That’s just how it is. I work for a subsidiary company, most people have been there for decades.
Why bring up Musk in every thread?
Dunno I didn't actually research what I said. It might have been a day.
Assuming it started when Commodus’ rule began in 177, and the actual collapse was the sack of Rome in 410, 233 years.
Options in Rome simply expired on the Friday. So it took a week…  Unless it was destroyed in a day by buying 0DTEs.
Over 1300 years. The Roman empire moved the capital  to Constantinople (now Istanbul)  in 324. It finally fell to the Ottoman Turks in 1452.
About 28 hours. /s
Longer than your  0DTE Puts.
There is no reason why it won't go back up and the selling will be psychological and not statistical. There is already a plan set in place and their personal activity in day to day operation has been reduced over the last few years
then he will most certainly have lost money
Nah I doubt it . he'll tell all other humans he enjoys making money and watch humans work as slave in large corporations.why you asked? Are you from justice league
Yeah I assumed he was saying like if buffet went tomorrow.  It would be munger I think

Yeah, true. I only ever have the B shares in mind
The original nine shares  issued for Australian mining company BHP in 1885 would now be worth about AUD35billion each. They have been split approximately 400 million to 1 since then.
You mean he hadn’t been secretly working on the becoming immortal?!
Imagine being such a twat that you literally carry a sink into the office as some kind of almost funny PR stunt.
He did foreshadow it by bringing a sink the first day.
Because as much as everyone thinks he’s a moron and terrible businessman, he’s successful made his way to world’s richest man and is constantly talked about either good or bad he stays relevant, so people are sour.
He didn't say Musk, but Musk was the first person that came to mind
Never mentioned him. Weird that you think of him.
They were talking about chapek
This is the DD I come here for.
It was probably the time it takes for me to lose all my money on my calls. About 5 days.

Did you watch that one Justice League episode where Savage wiped out everyone then lived on to regret it in the future? I liked it and also enjoyed his longer story arc in the CW series.

You honestly think an entire city would collapse about as fast as the destruction of your net worth?  No son, you lose money much faster than that.
Good bot
Cousin Greg?
I knew a guy, who knew a guy who knew Kevin's dog.
Man, bull
Was he dead before they put the heart in his body? Or are they tossing random animal hearts in people to see what happens?
Much of Rome was sacked over 3 days. Also there was a fire many years before that destroyed 2/3rds of it in less than week.
Are you sure about that? Because I am 99.99999% sure that Fibocrypto is not a bot.  ---  ^(I am a neural network being trained to detect spammers | Summon me with !isbot <username> |) ^(/r/spambotdetector |) [^(Optout)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=whynotcollegeboard&subject=!optout&message=!optout) ^(|) [^(Original Github)](https://github.com/SM-Wistful/BotDetection-Algorithm)

The actual collapse took over 2 centuries
It was more or a less a lighthearted chirp about u/imeaniguess3’s ability to lose money.  If only he could be as good at earning money as he is a losing it… he could break even (less trading fees).
I'm more sure than you
I thought spez banned bots?
A bit cold though
They call that two Mungers.
I see.
If this was in the US, I definitely would be doing the opposite of what they say.

Lmao all the 370 qqq call holders screaming at their screen right now 😂
Short trading week, people will take profit. Make sure to buy calls at open bulls to get rekt
Accidentally bought some lined shorts. Who wears lined shorts? I get it for swimming trunks, but for regular shorts? Kinda gross I dunno. At least the swim trunks are in the chlorinated water.
the choices are hard to make.  short term tbills which actually yield something or APPL.   i was wrong about people not buying IPhones when people were getting laid off in 2020.  I was wrong about people nit buying IPhones during the 2023 layoffs.  i think when people loose income they automatically buy an iphone, which is good for apple.   this probally applies tp TSLA too
My only regret is not buying more Rivian calls
3 stacks of high society ready to be fomo'd into tsla calls at open
I think I’ll get my fix today by going to the regular casino

Selling 0DTE SPY options today should be illegal
My friend says PUTS are for PUTOS! 🤔🥃🥃🥃🥃🥃🥃
Everyone wants to know why coin is mooning.  Let me explain as I’ve been following this for a bit. There are a lot of very clever people who thought they saw an obvious crash coming and loaded shorts at much lower levels. It got up to around 23% SI. Super easy money. The SEC is coming for them.  Then the wells notice came and that was the chance for it to crash. Except it didn’t. It went down for a day then stated rising again. Shorts got nervous because this wasn’t supposed to happen and as it goes higher and higher more shorts start to panic. It’s a reverse crash now or a short squeeze and could go much higher with the current price levels and massive short interest. It’s done this before a couple of times over the past few months in mini squeezes that sent it up to $80+ but then crashed again.  That could happen again but somehow this one feels different. Shorts seem extra desperate to create FUD in this name and are trying their best to create a bank run by spreading rumors about people getting locked out. But it hasn’t been working. Now I think the real panic is going to set in. This is a super crowded short with dumb money bears piled in at lower levels. I could see this one opening $90+ on Wednesday.  Look at the volume today. More than the 10 day average on a half day before a holiday when volumes should be light.
Crayons down
market is closed  i fomo'd $20k into rivian last minute

Corn is stupid.   What're you going to do if corn does become adopted as the currency? The government is going to to pass a law requiring you to register your wallets. Then, they'll be able to monitor all your transactions and tax you accordingly.   Corn is the opposite of what Corn enthusiasts claim it is.   Corn is stupid.

Over traded today. Went from +$500 for the day to around -$1300.  Two mistakes. Not cutting my loss at my mental stop level. Made a second trade and not taking profits when it broke green.  Taking  a fifth trade of the day and not calling it quits.
As a bear I said in the weekend thread I wouldn’t bet against Apple cause it’s a machine. I still feel that way. I think Apple is very bullish and will continue to go up.
It's 4th of July you didt thonk we turn green come on now.

Do those mfkers understand how much work is actually involved in something like hunting for food or foraging for berries?

The China chip ban thing isn't even the worst news for semis. The US is starting to regulate exports for national security reasons due to AI.
Good morning fellow degens ![img](emote|t5_2th52|8883)
Spx Green on Open?
Elon still pumping the Dogcorn....  Still doesn't want to do it himself with his own company though, still trying to force McDonalds to accept it first.  Trying to trigger a bull run by forcing the Golden Arches into a publicity stunt.  Well I mean they gave that Korean Boy Band their own worldwide special meal a few years ago..... So it's not beyond them I guess. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|12787)
Also my bullish take on DraftKings: if you’re invested, you feel less bad Everytime you lose, you’re generating revenue ![img](emote|t5_2th52|8882)
What’s up with aapl
I decided to cancel my day off today. I figure they might do an early close. if not. I normally do about 2 hours of work I think then shit post on reddit, today I will aim for 30 minutes.
spy and Q’s will move plus minus 0.02% all day while we all watch 🤡
When someone told me Cathie woods unloaded some tsla before delivery I knew what to do

RIVN !!!
Market down chips up that’s the way we like to
Opinions on DAL?
Hey tesla go back up
SPX 0DTE for 3.5 hours
Opened the recycling yesterday, filled with 80s hustlers. Giggity
Bears on life support. And Tesla just pulled the plug
No days off 🖨️ 💰
Is 12k deliveries suppose to be slot for Rivian?
Futies close same time as regular market today? I ask because i have a couple of es bull spreads 🤡
yeah so TSLA's strategy of reducing pricing to increase volumes clearly paid off. Not only is it great to actually hit above their numbers, the financial impact of moving the fixed cost to variable and utilizing their plant capacity is beneficial to the bottomline.
#MURICAAA
Friendly reminder to inverse yourself. Good luck today!
I can’t chose which to buy first tsla or spy
We drilling? Where’s the American spirit?
Let me save you the trouble of looking at your chart all day  Qs end at 370  spy ends at 443

JPM analyst lifted his TSLA PT from 115 to 120 LMAO.
COME ON RIVN GET UP
Sold my Rivian calls as soon as the market opened. Could’ve earned $2k more if I waited 10 mins. Fuck this shit.
AAPL needs to say their EV is going to be created with generative AI or something to save these calls
RIVN TO MOON
AMD has a lot of of room to run, don’t sleep on it
Sell the news it seems.
Sheesh glad I took profit and dipped out of AMD
[deleted]
I’m a simple man. If it breaks $444, I buy calls
Bulls, it's just like when fucking, you gotta pull back a little before you push up again. We're gonna hit the market's cervix today.
Is now a good time to buy TSLA calls? /s
don’t forget market close at 1![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260)
We’re entering into a down cycle but it really doesn’t feel like one.
Apple isn’t holding this 3T valuation ![img](emote|t5_2th52|18630)
TSLA is the basically the EV industry so if they have good results their smaller rivals also benefit.  RIVI up 40% in 1 week.![img](emote|t5_2th52|29637)
Telsa going ATH eoy
Kicking my ass for not buying those RIVN calls Friday 🤪

Revenge puts on tsla and Bitcoin not working out
Summer sales, so I treated myself to new shoes. Can't be givin all my money to MM 🤪
Momentum can change on a dime! Just before the recent AI hype, NVDA was marking down GPUs and working through a massive inventory glut and declining sales in Q3 & 4 of 2022. Then ChatGPT emerged, and MSFT bet billions on it. All of a sudden the AI rage was on. I’d give NVDA a couple of quarters of earning reports until the hype slows down and the focus shifts somewhere else
For hardcore degenerates:      Futures will reopen at regular time tonight @ 6PM EST and will stay open until 1PM EST tomorrow. Extended hours trading for today remains open until 8PM EST.

Why is SPY moving like a 3 month treasury bill today? This zero volatility day is weird. I guess theta gang is cleaning house like usual. I’m going to go look at my checking account to feel some volatility.
TSLA!!!!!
Idek why the market is only open till 1 today. That’s like a McDonald’s only being open for breakfast and then closing. Kinda pointless
So is the purpose of ‘work’ today just to keep me half-sober for 5 hours? No one is doing shit today. What a scam, fake, rigged, manipulated

Why does market close at 1pm
At leas IV is higher so my puts are not to much in the red

So is it a green or red or both today. Can't decide to pick a side

Damn, it’s been a rough few days for Harvard. They got away with insane tuition because people just used student loans to pay. Now people think twice. They got away with admitting ultra rich black kids and charging high tuition, while blocking poor Asian and white kids. Now they have to admit poor kids regardless of race. Now people are trying to ban legacy admissions so they’re gonna lose a ton of donations from billionaires. The Aunt Becky thing means they can’t sneak in rich kids as “athletes” in obscure sports. People don’t trust their graduates. Because of grade inflation, the most common grade is an A- and basically everyone graduates with a 3.7 or higher. Because of affirmative action, every black, Latino, Native American, etc. kid us going to be judged as stupid, but admitted due to their race. And every rich looking white kid is going to be judged as getting in because of legacy admissions. Worst of all, their ultra profitable endowment fund is starting to be treated/taxed as a for-profit hedge fund.

WHY didn’t my dumbass get TSLA calls. Literally had my cursor on the buy button for weeklies on Friday
They said it ‘Rivian Eyes Using AI To Make EVs Schedule Their Own Service’ and beats delivery estimates.  This is going out of orbit isn’t it ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|31225)
Pro tip: don’t short Tesla, it might not work out so well for you.  Or if you did, do post loss porn ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
RIVN TO DA MOON
Can you imagine what would happen if someone like DeepFuckingValue posted a new position in a random stock that he believed in once more? I lowkey want this kind of parabolic regard energy again.
TESLA PUMP YOU SON OF A BITCH! I DIDNT FOMO IN FOR YOU TO GO DOWN
Can we pump a cheap stock pls. I’m tired of super expensive stocks
Spy puts, all in ![img](emote|t5_2th52|18632)

Who is Tsla and why does everyone want to call them?
TSLA pulling up SPY by the nutsack

So 2yr yields just going back to 5. Something is gonna break soon
I drive to like Mercedes
So I heard assburgers gonna sell at open, as usual
tsla pre market volume is exceeding friday trading session
inflation, high interest rates and recession are good for stocks? why is everything at ATH?  🤔  tech companies are still doing layoffs
people who bought 445 calls on Friday 🤡
Dear stock gods, please allow institutions to trim big tech and rotate into PYPL.
BRUH I HATE PREMARKET! 씨발 진짜!!!! THEY GONNA MAKE US WATCH TSLA GET FADED FOR A WHOLE HOUR.
I just got home and seen a tiny squirrel chilling upright in a little pocket of sunlight. its going to be a good day boys

TSLA $370 EOY and I hit the dougie
Holy shit I’ve become so good at timing the market , tesla 300 when though. Just got out at the top
TSLA $287 eod
Took 50% profit on my 0dte SPY call. Should’ve let it run tho
Looks like crab day on spy and apple

TSLA is about to drop like a rock
Bye bye tesla
V is coming to save the day
Buy calls. Stock immediately drops. Buy more calls to average down. Stock goes down more. Cant explain that
Tesla should hit 295 eow
+20% in my calls should i sell
damn i like these half days of watching bull calls slowly get shredded ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
V is coming for bear Anus
It should 100% be illegal for money managers to program a computer to set the price of the market where they want it to fuck over the most people as possible
AAPL V pls
please god let power hour have some real movement
fuck it im throwing $$ in Tesla if futures are green tn

Diamond handed my TSLA and RIVN calls even tho both were up a decent amount earlier this morning.  Both those tickers and probably the rest of the EV market are going to run for the rest of the week. Not only do TSLA and RIVN have the momentum of deliveries increase catalysts behind them, there's the whole market sympathy aspect creating a positive feedback loop between the two.  RIVN 21 eow TSLA 300 eow
why u guys complaining about AAPL when it had ONE bad day? she on early vacay today
# I AINT NEVA GONNA MAKE MY MONEY BACK!

short tsla shares at open sounds like a good idea
It’s kinda funny watching Democrats get flustered as they explain why they aren’t racist.
Here we are coming up on the finest holiday in the US, the 4th of July, when americans take a break from murdering eachother to murder the sky with fireworks
Dear spy, Please gap down  Love Matt
$80 Tesla PT, LOL. Clown
NVDA 435C
Low volume pumps today
TSLA puts?
Shithole America   Tomorrow is a celebration of slavery, fraud and pillaging by the rich vs the poor   It’s all a scam. A set up.   As an example the reason your healthcare is a joke and expensive is to keep peons locked into dead end jobs as slaves for the corporations. “I nEeD tHe HeAltHcAre cOvErAge” and by designed it’s been made to only be accessible through employer sponsored programs.    It’s all set up to keep you in chains. America is a disgrace
Imagine betting against the most reasonably priced cars in the market rn
Can 9:30 hurry up? The way SPY is looking I just want to sell these TSLA calls lol
Not so cocky now, huh bull? It's over for you.
I’m tired of being bullied by u/rylar so this will be my last post in the daily thread![img](emote|t5_2th52|31226)

"What's this half day shit?  What's this bullshit? I don't f\*\*\*in' care! It don't matter to Jesus. But you're not foolin' me, man."
Like the market will actually be red before the 4th. Murica day
What happened with Tesla?
We are all just dust in the wind. Money isnt real. So buy FDs and pray to whatever the fuck you pray to that you hit the jackpot today. Dopamine then dead is all you got son.
I got these TSLA 300c expiring this week, I’m about to dump those bitches at open ![img](emote|t5_2th52|31249)

Spy gonna end today at 441 just so you guys know
ENRON 😵‍💫
I touch myself in church
Prices aren't going to come down significantly ever. If you're putting off major purchases in hopes of a market correction you're wasting purchasing power.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276) Tesler ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)
Why are we even trading today. SPY moons Wednesday.
Today is a bull trap setting up for correction this week (still long term uppies) ![img](emote|t5_2th52|8883)
Guess there’s no flush. Back into calls ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)
AAPL cooled off. 192 support holding so far. 195 eow
I put some Tito’s in my coffee this morning to make my work day a little better. Fuck if these people think they can ruin my 4th of bender

Bought QQQ calls at the top today and bag holding already. WTF I thought we get the independence day bigly pump and bears show up.![img](emote|t5_2th52|18632)
*morgan freeman pointing up emoji*
Y casino close?
They closed early today? Wtf. Fucken idiots.
How 2 gamble wen casino close 😩😩😩😩
Bears, you are just way too early. The Fed and other central backs have fucked up. Rates are still way too low and they are losing control of inflation. The fallout is still a ways off. In the meantime, buy some calls and make some money.
Have you seen me lately? 🎵![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260)

Everyone who bought TSLA calls today are in big trouble

Instead of blaming rich people for being born rich, blame your ancestors for being financially illiterate. Not anyone's fault you were born into a subpar family bloodline.

Tsla bulls are losers. 284 down to 276?
I hope SPY fills the gap Wednesday and drops to 430 Thursday.

Still time for a V after Euro close.
Enron should dump on these fools

All this fucking talk of AI. AI will fucking own you just like your iPhones and your iPads. You cunts are easily manipulated; you couldn’t even cash out on the AI craze but had to go lose everything like the degenerates that you all are.
So why Tesla pumping
🦅🦅🦅lets show ghey bers a 4th july pump today 🇺🇸🇺🇸
Short selling TSLA is gonna be free money in the mid and long term  I don't care about ghey options and daily  manipulation
Are we in a bear market again?
I like how all the crypto idiots are buying corn but not those miners or etf that’s running like hell. Smart people sell shovels to diggers who’ll eventually go broke

anyone creating VR googles is a total idiot. I hope apple dies in a fire their their VR headset.
Honestly I'm just gonna buy Tesla and hold it until 20-30 years after Musk's death.....  That always seems to be the sweetest spot 30 years after the main guy has died....
Today's gonna be flat as shit :(
This Tesla pump is mediocre. I’m guessing the more aggressive call holders will break even. The less aggressive ones will make like 30-50%
Elon is literally the autist we all aspire to me  And I hate it
Retail FOMO'ed 1.5 billion into tech stocks last week. What could possibly go wrong?

fuck, remember when we were called essential workers? so much disrepect nowadays. i used to love working behind wendy's.. now it's just a fucking job to make end's meet.
Ima need that pullback to 436 today
I could see TSLA losing about 2-3% in this next 12 minutes to get options cucked by theta.
Tesla bulls need to be steady. Don’t shoot all the bullets early
Volumes dying, sell off begins.

spy going green on half day? bears better be hiding come Wednesday
Wtf why is the market still open?
I don't really understand the recession talks.   Everywhere I go it's packed with people *spending money*. Grocery store, bars, malls. Most people still have money, and a nice pile on the side for emergencies. Banks just got stress tested. Inflation is coming down. What's the catalyst to the downside? There isn't one.
I hate it to be paypal long holder

Wtf why is TSLA dropping for no reason?
$SPY pinned between $443 and $444 via option volume. Well, this sucks. I can’t make a move.
Pulled off second trade for a total of $500 this morning. Amazing upper profit limit. Took the chance 2/2.
I just wish I had put more $ in RIVN from my 401k, instead of just $1800 😒😒😒 up 30% since…

The allocation of stocks in the S&P is actually beauitfully calibrated. One mega cap could go under and the rest would prop it up. Meanwhile if another mega cap moons, the index moves up significantly.

did anything from Tesla's business change? as far as i know:  * cybertruck still is not being produced or delivered, while Ford and [now Chevy](https://www.thestreet.com/electric-vehicles/tesla-rival-chevy-rolls-out-electric-version-of-a-classic-model) are already delivering their EV pickup trucks  * robotaxis nonexistent (except by Google's Waymo or Ford's Cruise)  * FSD still functions the same as last year (Level 2)  * i see photos of broken down Tesla Semis still, and they are [being recalled with low estimated production](https://insideevs.com/news/672505/tesla-semi-second-recall-hints-at-low-production-numbers/)  🤔

Got my testosterone test back and surprised to find out I was in the bottom 4-9% for non-obese men - so really low. I was prescribed a testosterone booster from these results.  Hopefully I’ll be shredded after being on this a couple month. Also hope this will increase my sex drive so much to the point, as Megan Thee Stallion says -  I need a mop to clean the floor, there’s too much drip   🍑⛈️🌈

The old saying is true: bull markets start in the dark. Nobody watches the market last Friday and today on Monday. That's when the gains are here. Don't be surprised next Monday when it's a sea of red. And next Friday when it's massively green.  ruling out holiday trading: Mondays typically red to scare out the market. Friday afternoons massively green.
Sold tesla shares, bought 280p
I’m about to go full send on COIN puts

All I ever hear about is Tesla. Do you fucking cunts even have a brain, or was it programmed in like the automatons that you all are? God damn, why do I have to co-live with such fucktards. You all disgust me with your stupidity.

Here’s why NVDA will double in two months:  TLDR, conservative bias   When NVDA’s quarterly results are about to be released, investors typically form expectations about the company's financial performance. These expectations are often based on a combination of factors, including historical data, industry trends, analysts' forecasts, and the company's own guidance. However, conservatism bias can influence these expectations in the following ways:  Underestimating positive news: NVDA Investors with conservatism bias may be inclined to underestimate the potential for positive news or better-than-expected results. They may be overly cautious in revising their expectations upward, even if there are indications that the company's performance could exceed previous estimates.   This bias can lead to a more conservative forecast of NVDA’s stock's price movement, potentially causing investors to miss out on opportunities for profit if the results turn out to be better than anticipated. Overemphasizing negative news:   Conversely, conservatism bias can lead NVDA investors to overemphasize negative news or risks associated with the upcoming quarterly results. They may be more inclined to give greater weight to potential pitfalls or downward trends, even if the evidence suggests a more favorable outcome.   This bias can result in a more pessimistic outlook for NVDA’s stock's price movement, leading to potential missed opportunities for investors if the results turn out to be better than feared. Slow adjustment to new information: Investors affected by conservatism bias may exhibit a slower adjustment to new information or data that contradicts their initial expectations. They may require stronger evidence or more conclusive results before revising their beliefs.   This reluctance to update expectations quickly can lead to delayed reactions to quarterly results, potentially impacting the timing of investment decisions or causing missed opportunities.

I asked ChatGPT to explain to me why my Nvda 500 calls for next earnings will make me rich:  When quarterly results are about to be released, investors typically form expectations about the company's financial performance.

They may require stronger evidence or more conclusive results before revising their beliefs.

Made a cool 155k off NNDM in 2021 riding it from like 2 dollars to 15 (didn't time exactly perfectly but pretty close). I'm back in and it's up 30% in the last few trading days since earnings. Wouldn't mind if it went on a little run again so I can buy the premium tendies.

I thought if NVDA went red that it would fall from grace. I guess the Bulls still have faith in this stock.
If the crayons play right / no “sell the news” sentiment… we’re actually bullish on TSLA & I might lose my $275 ban bet ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260)
Oh nice the markets open looks like I still have plenty of time 🤠
"If I see this rally continue for another 8 months I will become bullish."   Imagine this guy managing your money.
If you don’t buy apple calls on this dip, why are you trading.

What's you all's perspective on CTS Eventim? Lost 20% recently on a controversy, but been very stable for two weeks now. It's by far the biggest event ticket supplier in Germany and other parts of Europe. Earnings have been growing a *lot* for the past few years. Only thing I'm sort of afraid of, as a German, is a relative concert drought in Germany this year, which I guess could negatively impact earnings. Not sure though.   Honestly thinking about going in with a pretty big lever, but would love to hear some more opinions.

Someone at the #FederalReserve forgot to move a decimal point...  "In one example of the discrepancy, the Fed projected that Bank of America will post $22.3 billion in other comprehensive income over a nine-quarter period under a hypothetical set of adverse economic conditions. Bank of America, however, projects $12.5 billion for that metric during the period..."  https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-03/bofa-says-it-started-talks-with-fed-after-stress-test-results

Hey whiskytangofoxtrot08,  While I understand that language can slip sometimes, I kindly request you to refrain from using the Lord's name in vain.

I want to assure you that I'm here to spread positivity, not to offend anyone. I respect all faiths, even if we don't agree, and I'm open to respectful discussions and mutual understanding.

True but it’s not like it’s better anywhere else. The key to truly being free is to just not be poor. The key to not being poor is to have been born into a wealthy family. How does a poor person born into poverty escape the poor house? Luck! Therefore, I will gamble (because of my American given rights) into the “free” markets and hope to catch an option chain that will catapult me to into the stars

No one is losing control of inflation my guy, prices are coming down and actually accelerating down. The Fed doesn’t have to do shit, they just gonna chill till all you plebs lose your jobs.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|27189)
you should also mention the AI run on most big techs which represent a huge weighting of SPY and obviously nasdaq
The reason why permabears are so insufferable is because they focus on the wrong fucking thing and still believe they are right. Macro economy ≠ Equities market performance. It's like media blaming deposit flight and inflation to be the main reason behind the 2 banks being forcefully liquidated when the real reason is actually paper bond losses exceeding their total equities value. [Give this a read](https://twitter.com/KobeissiLetter/status/1675529419551539201) and stop fucking citing runaway inflation as some looming doomsday event, they peddled the same shit leading up to the '08 crash. Institutes and whales own majority of the equities in market and none of them give a fuck about problems affecting the average struggling retail
Yesh

People aren't gonna stop buying groceries dude. Also Americans will continue spending excessively until they can't, and then they'll keep doing it. Most people are financially illiterate. We will get confirmation when the credit card companies report this quarter.
interest rates. yield curve inversion. housing market. These will most likely crush spending in a few months.
Rates? For real, in germany there will be a fuckton less new buildings bc firms line strabag etc cant pay up. 1 percent rate hike equals about 2€ more rent per qm.

In Michigan they are practically giving away weed.  Ounces for less than $50.  1g oil carts are ten for $90 (for comparison, in Illinois they are 1 cart for $90).  Basic economics have arrived and weed is now a cheap commodity.  Now factor in that TLRY is a *Canadian* company with hardly any business in the US, plus they used investors buttholes as ATMs by diluting many times, and there's no way TLRY is ever mooning again.  $MSOS is the only viable weed play.

tl;dr
No one expects costs to go down. Inflation is going down
It's the rate that inflation has changed, not the inflation itself...
Let's do an example. If your favorite large red dildos cost $10 in June of 2020 but then they cost $11 in June of 2021, red dildo inflation is 10%.  By June of 2022 if they cost $11.55 red dildo inflation is 5%. Now by June of 2023 they cost $11.78 and red dildo inflation is only 2%.  Your costs haven't gone down at all. But "inflation" has gone down to 2%. Inflation is typically reported as a 12 month metric comparing the same month from the previous year. A lot of media has tried reporting on this metric month to month to make the number appear smaller because inflation has been so bad the past 18 months.
its always inflating, but now just not as fast.
Because inflation has gone down, not prices. Like it's more, but at a slower rate.  Man, the lack of math here is astounding. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640)

You access it through something called the Tor browser that used to make it more or less impossible to identify your IP.  Then you put in weird addresses that you find using the Tor browser to access boards with different topics.  It's a lot harder to actually be anonymous now and there are a lot of law enforcement traps.  I don't recommend it to anyone, it's called "dark" for very good reasons.  I wouldn't even do a search for the Tor browser at this point on any device remotely linked to my name.  Very bad idea to try to satisfy your curiosity.

Looking solid.   Anyone bought above $20+ is still pretty oof tho.  It'll take a lot to get back above $30+ given valuation matters again for EVs (unless you're TSLA I guess)

Cash account will take a day or more to settle any funds from a trade or deposit. So if you use all your buying power in a trade, sell, will not be able to enter another trade until the funds are settled. If you deposit, will have to wait until it’s cleared. Just so you are aware

*Neither is Taco Bell (2.0) Chipotle.*
"That's why you're poor and stupid" - VisualMod, probably
Xi just restricted export of gallium which is important for chips, solar ect, as retaliation for the chip export ban
China is putting restrictions on raw materials exports neede to make chips in some tit for tat shit with the US. That’s going to affect a lot of tech heavyweights. The US also just banned imports of minerals crucial for EV battery production from countries that engage in child labor

Yeah it does. Tsla is a solid company that is well ran. I just feel like the EV market has a ton more expansion coming. Especially with the TSLA price cuts. More people can enter the market now
Then, I missed out I guess. I’m not gonna chase it though 😞
Yep. I was 20% up and now I’m down. Hopefully I can bring it back in the remaining 25 mins

Good explanation seriously. They wanted it to go up so looks at delivery numbers while ignoring the left-over inventory for the 4th consecutive quarter and decreasing margins with even more discounts for its China segment
Oh alright, thanks

What I’m thinking too. Picked up 3 195 calls for 7/14
Oh but I do got the balls, bought those calls 15 minutes back ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)
Nah Google is worse
Will create a dip that gets bought instantly probably
Be careful what you wish for
Unless it was already priced in
Is that why your puts are doing so good?
Asset values are very much linked with monetary policy.  Monetary policy is the single most important thing any one should focus on when accessing economic outcomes.

Unbelievable
I think they're just like weirdly excited to get work done and lunch just doesn't occur to them as a priority, at least that's how it's always seemed to me.  Like I'm not a new guy or unaccomplished, I'm good at my job and stuff, but I've always always always prioritized lunch.  I've never been like "oh man there's an open spot!"  Either in the afternoon or the next day. I'm hungry.
You ruin my day man.  I'm like gearing up to go make my food and then I get a reminder.  Guess I'll eat lunch some other day.

I think it’ll still need to drop a bit more I don’t know that much about that stocks I don’t know when to buy or sell yet I have to study more about it before I invest it could go higher
It went so high today thou do you think it’ll keep going high maybe reach $1 ?
Yes dropping $5 in a short time would be considered tanking

Hey justhp,  While I understand that language can slip sometimes, I kindly request you to refrain from using the Lord's name in vain. It holds deep significance to many Christians, and using it in such a manner can be hurtful to their faith.  Instead of "God D***", find alternative phrases such as "Goodness gracious" or "Golly gee".  My purpose is to share the love and teachings of Jesus Christ. I want to assure you that I'm here to spread positivity, not to offend anyone. I respect all faiths, even if we don't agree, and I'm open to respectful discussions and mutual understanding. Let's walk this journey together with kindness and love!  *Micah 6:8 (NIV): "He has shown you, O mortal, what is good. And what does the LORD require of you? To act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God."*  ---    ^This ^message ^was ^sent ^automatically. ^Did ^I ^make ^a ^mistake? ^Let ^me ^know ^by ^sending ^me ^a ^direct ^message.

I’ve checked multiple SD and it’s converging also volume continuing to decrease, usually indicative of a large move in one direction.
I'm going to need you to get a 2nd sub alright?
what do you have basic sub ? Standard and standard with Ads  allows 2  , basic is the one that only allows 1. but you might as well just get standard with ads since it's cheaper and you can run on 2 tvs
That’s not what I’m talking about PERVERT!  It’s like Kid Rock

Really expensive
So expensive bro

Ohh, that might be fun, I played both of those
I never trade more than 2% of my capital on a single trade and also picked up XBS calls that were up 105% before close, so I'm good.  Looking for a quick scalp at open as people take profit or around FOMC minutes on Wednesday.  Otherwise I'll bail, eat the loss and buy calls.

Hi MR. MEESEEKS ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260)
I was giving financial advice. Not looking for a teammate
your OG comment said 'to high"
I really want to know
Excellent play  I like to take my initial stake out when I'm up significantly and let the rest of my profit ride when I'm up significantly.
Not entirely. I had 6 contracts and sold 4 to cover my principle + grab profits. Only runners left
VM, be nice to me :(
My 4Runner tires were $2000
Depends on your state but standard pricing is anywhere between 400 to upwards of 1k. You are not just paying for new wheels, this includes tyre change, wheel alignment and other services wrapped in one. Ask for takeoffs and wait for sales before you buy one if you think 600 is too much.
I have money so im not a good person to compare yourself to

Your country would be vastly superior if you stayed 😎  Plus slavery would have ended sooner in the USA, and all the knock on effects from that.   Plus together we would have curb stomped the Nazis back in 1939, and wouldn't have let Russia invade eastern Europe and set up the cold war.   The world would have been a better place if we stayed close
At least his still works 🤣

well if u have a 14 year up-trend (2x historical average) then maybe its not crazy that it takes 2x as long for the down-trend to hit?

I personally might invest in something like cureleaf but I’m not super bullish on any of it
I wouldn’t bet the farm on it, but I bought 6000 shares at the beginning of the day and will hold onto the stock a go for the ride. You never know how fast and how high these type of stocks can go really
Not for a 275 per share stock 😂
Yeah
No, since this market is completely disconnected from fundamentals.  TA and valuation is meaningless. Anyways maybe will get back in next year but TBills for me

No, its not, if you're just browsing you're fine   It can get very illegal very quickly if you engage and especially if you download.  Like anything else, if you know what you're doing, not much risk.  Stumble around ignorant and curious - a lot of risk.
technically it is a way how US is going to fight war now. UA wont send its soldiers to die anywhere. but they will fund and help other nations to fight. by doing this they would save theyr own soldiers and thru these nations direct the geopolitical outsomes

Damn, I wonder why people would draw the same conclusions about something for 13 years?  Yeah, you could have made money. I'm not arguing that. Im saying, btc isn't what the people who push btc, say it is. The whole idea that you're going to be your own bank, and have monetary privacy, escape the centralized authorities, etc. Is stupid.

Hi BF
Likely not. A lot of companies already came out and said they have no plans to upgrade hardware due to budget restrictions
I got 7/27 and 8/18 puts. I might leverage a couple calls before earnings, but I’m mostly bearish since it’s rallied so much already. With the Biden administration banning exports to China I wouldn’t put to much favor in their earnings. There is a lot of American companies backing them though, so it’ll be interesting to see how it plays out.
There are much more calls actually
Omg, what a fucking clown. Sure buddy, that's what you're doing.

What about Succboi E Money?
First emperor of China died chugging mercury cuz he thought it'd make him live forever.   People also use Bitcoin network to facilitate international transactions across currencies. These are both tangential use cases to the primary store of value each have historically been used as.
It is exactly that as we speak tho, what is your point ? I could buy whatever I want right now, provided the other party accepts bitcoin, without anyone being able to tie that transaction to my name, without needing a bank or a financial service in between. And all that with a very little fee and a transaction speed that is almost like giving the other party the money in cash.

Holy shit! That’s a nice airport. Yup, that settles it! Mexico is now officially better than America in terms of both heal care and architecture. Obviously don’t look at cities like Juarez, but yea Mexico is totally safe, clean and not corrupt based on that beautiful design of their new airport  Look, we all know the truth about America. I won’t even defend the “American dream” but there aren’t other places that are better. There are other places that have better pros, but they also have worse cons. Maybe the Scandinavian countries are better. They at least rank much higher on the liberty index than America
Lol ok so basically you are Cuban or South American and moved to America and only vote red because you’re terrified of communism. Got it. Lmao

Too much bullshit for me, where price targets pulled out of analysts’ asses have more effect on a stock than actual news.  NVDA for example is going to be affected by a partial chip sale ban to China but an analyst raised its price target for like the 3rd time without giving more than speculation. Thank God I didn’t buy NVDA puts at least

nope  he is Smokey Bear.  Start asking your friends. I was surprised at how many of them knew it was not Smokey the Bear  and really I'm going to have to get high if i carry on with this conversation   or not even.
Dude seriously Mexico and Brazil are some of the highest crime and corruption riddled countries in the world! I mean if you had mentioned Northern European countries as a better example of nations with more liberties, I would’ve agreed. But you used the absolute worst countries as an example of some utopia. You are an angry individual my friend

His account was banned from reddit he was also an incel and posted shit like "Women need to be forced to re-distribute sex in the bedroom" saying women should be forced to sleep with incels like him
He is around using a different ID
He used a hack on Robinhood to get jacked to the tits with leverage then yoloed 50k on Apple puts. Apple beat and the rest is history. Guh!

He also claimed he had “sired” many children when people called him an incel
Holy fuck, I’ll never look at his visage the same way again. Serves that little shit right
It also posted "DD" on how people should short companies with women managers or management and only invest in companies that had all male management
Sounds like he had some serious mental issues.
I give all my action to my Eskimo friend. He takes the dogs and sled into the big city once a month and puts in my buy and sell orders.
Ibkr
IBKR and I don't trade on the TSX or the Venture, not enough volatility.
Interactive Brokers.  Also can do via big banks like RBC, TD
American here, invested in USD denominated Canada Bitcoin ETF traded on TSX on Fidelity. It's not like regular investing though where I just hit a few buttons on my phone - had to literally call and talk to a human on the phone and wait for them to put the order down on the trading desk. Took like 45 min to do a few trades, and the commission on each trade was like $80, lol. Felt a little like Gordon Gecko though so that lessened the commission sting.
Canadian here, i inest all in american market.
TD Direct Investing Tax Free Savings account. You only pay tax on gains, so your not going to have to worry about that.
Something to watch out for that I found out the hard way, if you invest in US stocks on canadian apps (wealthsimple, etrade, itrade etc) with canadian funds you’ll get charged 2.5% every time you buy and sell. So even if they only charge like 5$ per transaction you’re getting fucked on the exchange rate, 5% to buy and sell unless if you limit yourself to the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX), and then your choice of canadian companies to invest in is seriously limited.
I bought Shares of Canadian Solar (CSIQ) when it was 17. Rode it up to high 40s and cashed out.
Canada is a failing country. I would advise finding a way to short the nation
Wealthsimple and questrade
Anything that starts and extinguishes fires is what to invest in Canada lately
Pretty sure everywhere requires you to pay taxes on stock market gains
We travel back through time and buy that $20K Vancouver houses everybody wants now.
Wealthsimple, the Canadian Robin Hood to save on fees. It’s pretty much useless for day trading though without a companion app. There’s MOGO trade that’s low/no fee trading as well but they are a sketchy payday loan company. Questrade is a good option if you want to day trade, but charges you fees for trading. Other than that, you get the pleasure of using your bank’s investment platform which is basically throwing your money away. Most of these platforms will charge crazy high fees for currency conversion on US stocks.   You can open a trade account as a TFSA(tax free savings account) where any gains are tax free unless you are day trading I. Which case you get bonus taxes. It is invested in using already taxed money, but your funds can be withdrawn at any time without penalty. we also have RRSPs as well, which are registered retirement savings plans that you invest pre-tax money in and you are taxed on it when you withdrawal money.   If you mean what I invest in that’s Canadian, Resource industry. The only thing we have going for us at this point that isn’t tied to a global pump and dump scheme.
I usually stock up on syrup and hockey tickets early in the year
Also Ben Felix on YouTube is a Canadian head not sure if he talks much on his actual brokerage and such though
I send my trades by carrier pigeon to the northwest trading post.  From there it gets bundled with other people's trades and send by dog sled to Canada's 1 and only brokerage.  I receive confirmation of my trade in Morse code sent out in the northern lights.
Move to America and quit being a hat
By voting Trudeau out of office.
BMO InvestorLine self service. Hi commission fees but good interface, great knowledgeable customer services and high level of freedom. They seem to get a good deal on market prices compared to the bid ask spreads. It just sucks doing $100 side bets and being down 10-15% as soon as you buy.
You can buy an ETF. EWC seems to be popular
Buy cases of maple syrup and hockey pucks
People get the notion that Canada is apocalypse proof, I mean it is since it's got big giant ass lakes that makes it difficult for desertification to occur, when planet temperatures start doing the feedback loop dance with the Siberian tundra.
Barrels of Maple syrup 😋
Maple syrup
I use BMO and before I tried TD and Quest trade as well
Canadian here I incest too
Calls on maple syrup, puts on the Toronto maple leafs.
Why the fuck would I do that?
I invest outside of Canada.  Canada is a shithole that's hurtin for certain.         I used questrade there and IBKR.
Yeah, mine travel by sled too and are sometimes intercepted by a polar bear: *Fun Fact* not too many people know that's where "Bearish" comes from.
Thats wierd. I do all my trades online
Through what system/agency/app do u invest in US? And how much do you pay for taxes?
I pay Wealth Simple $10 cad a month so I don't have to pay 2.5% per transaction.
Exactly. Which is why I dunno what I should do.
Google 'Norbert gambit'  to learn how to exchange your funds for no additional charge beyond the actual rate of exchange
Dame it.
Thanks for all the info. I’ve been searching different apps or agencies I can use to invest on US stocks, but couldn’t. Why is everything so hard in Canada?
Thanx!
Laughed out loud for a solid 20 seconds from this comment, best thing I've read all week! Happy fourth of July you free bastard!
Then you still have to transfer USD into your account, has to get converted somewhere. I know with itrade you can do Norbert’s gambit but takes a few days. No option for that on WealthSimple since they don’t support dual listed stocks.
Can use itrade and do Norbert’s Gambit to fund a USD account, and back when you sell. Or only invest in canadian securities but there aren’t many to choose from  on the TSX that you’d recognize - basically Shopify, Blackberry and Aurora Cannabis if I remember.
Yep I know of it - can’t do it on Wealthsimple, you can do it on itrade tho takes a few days
Use Interactive Brokers.
Ninja Trader?
You thanked a bot.  Sorry (read it with a Canadan accent).
Thank you
You can store USD in your account without paying $10/mo if the sum of all your accounts exceeds $100,000. I think the exchange rate charge is still 1.5% but I'm not sure.  Actually, you can leverage the exchange rate to your benefit.  We'll likely never have dollar parity again, but if you buy USD ~ 80c if you sell at 60c you get way more canadian dollars. This concept is why many resources exporters, farmers and manufacturers in Canada like the BoC keeping the Canadian dollar low. In a quarter with CAD decline of 3%, your company exporting to the US gets a free 3% growth.  This concept in general is why I always prefered American stocks to Canadian for investing, regardless of trading.
Right but what I’m saying is to get USD to put into that account as a Canadian you need to get it from somewhere, and Norbert’s gambit is the only way to transfer CAD to USD without any fees. Otherwise transferring 100k to USD is gonna cost you $1500, and another $1500 to convert it back for $3k/3% total.
So someone selling bonds is saying that the stock market is crashing ?
PIMCO is a permabear.
Pimcock

PIMCO like Mike Wilson are so out of their depth for making a call on up, down or sideways.  If someone told them the Konami code, I’m sure their newsletter to their clients would have just about as much luck as the next person.

That's kinda what I was thinking. Don't know anything about anything but isn't that the whole idea of the rate hikes? To slow everything down, reduce growth a bit, and curb inflation?
I swear I've been reading this exact same comment for like 2 years now. I think they are trying to prevent it from happening as long as possible. Because they know that we are going to take all of their recession stimulus money and buy tons of stock in these companies at their lowest point.  Those mfs don't wanna share.

you don’t know how to read economic data that was released today or in the past months. nor do you know anything about economics.
Twins?
Well, if layoffs happen the the unemployment rate goes up. That’s all Powell needs to stop raising the rates. Of course the market will go up with no rate hikes
You feeling like you are in a recession doesn’t make it a recession. We’ve been using the same metrics for decades. 2% GDP is not a recession.
Dude.  >These are not 8 straight months.  Look at f\*king April. Also this is the manufacturing one holy sh\*t.
You literally linked the PMI below you regard.  Actually maximum regard:  >The ISM manufacturing index, also known as the purchasing managers' index (PMI), is a monthly indicator of U.S. economic activity based on a survey of purchasing managers at more than 300 manufacturing firms.  [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ism-mfg.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ism-mfg.asp)  You literally link wrong and old data to mislead people.
So what? First of all, we are a service based economy, so ISM Services means more to the overall economy. Second, contraction doesn't necessarily mean decline, and even if it does, when? We also have unemployment below 4%. Bottom line, there's no substantial evidence to definitely say we are in the bad times.
Lol we started a recession in quarter two of 2022 when the two negative gdp people only say the 08 crash cuz that’s when Lehman happened the downfall started as early as 06.- started breaking in December of 07 and broke in September of 08 and carried into 09 with lingering effect till 2011 but all in all it was a 3 year process… we literally had banks fail bigger than Lehman and we still deny we are in a recession? It’s mind boggling people are just going more and more in debt
 No we haven’t. That’s the point people are trying to get across to you.
This chart represents the ISM Manufacturing Index
I literally counted OP posting PMI manufacturing five times and you posting PMI composite once and linking it once. It might be you are arguing with yourself. :)

If I had to guess you go to an Ivy League and might have a summer internship on wallstreet   Every intern research paper sounds just like this post   If you want to stand out think outside the box and stop writing like you are submitting an English final on the economy
Too much debt out there, tightened lending standards and student loan repayments = crimp markets
Understanding the index would be the first step before making a comment like this. 8 straight months of contraction means 8 months of the index below 50. An index value below 50 means the sector is contracting.

you’re looking at the wrong index.  https://preview.redd.it/j3jghc5sos9b1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e081851817eb2f813af07f36d6f8075e4b83722b
So what just ignore economics that have shown this is a time to buckle down and just recklessly spend cuz if that is happening that is scary and can effect me so o don’t want that to be happening so it isn’t
It’s important to consider various factors to gain a comprehensive understanding of the economy.  Claims have been steadily rising for a while and the unemployment rate is showing signs of deteriorating. It’s also essential to recognize that sustained slowdown in manufacturing can have wider implications. The manufacturing industry affects employment, supply chains, and various other sectors. Thus, monitoring the state of the factory sector is crucial in assessing the overall economic health.  The 8 consecutive months of contraction and reduced customer demand also raise concerns. Economic indicators help us identify challenges faced by the manufacturing industry, which can have a broader impact.  I am happy to discuss the other most recent economic data with you and how everything as a whole is showing a slow down. This is just this weeks data and I like to keep everyone knowledgeable because as mentioned it’s not always easy for the average regard or WSB user to parse through the data.
so. to be clear. you are disputing facts? okay. bye.
ISM and PMI are the same thing. How can someone this regarded post old data and talk about macro economics ![img](emote|t5_2th52|31226)   ISM stands for Institute of Supply Management which is the institution releasing the information.
I'm surrounded by the blind and regarded  https://preview.redd.it/z52eiamva0ab1.png?width=731&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4cbf870c3010344f46a01f4f17b3209f13635e19
We always had debt and student loans
Its giving https://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=107926751
Extremely regarded actually. ISM is the institution Institute of Supply Management which releases the index which in turn is the PMI index. Look at your own picture it says PMI regard.
You’re the one who has been posting the incorrect charts, and can’t handle being told that you’re wrong.
[deleted]
Cognitive dissonance
We had debt and loans with incredibly low borrowing costs due to 10-15 years of ZIRP and QE. Now it is way more expensive to borrow due to higher rates. Trillions in corporate debt will mature the next year or two and have to be rolled over to much higher rates. That or businesses will go bankrupt or curtail spending and hiring. Commercial real estate has the same problem. Trillions will have to be refinanced soon at much higher rates.
[deleted]
what incorrect charts? you’re dumb.
No! The PMI composite is including services. If you talk about factories it's about manufacturing. PMI Manufacturing + PMI Services = PMI Composite. You're actually 100% wrong on every front.
That's what I said yes. Now explain why you linked old data and said it went down for 8 months in a row. I'm listening!
Dude literally EVERY SINGLE CHART that you’ve posted in this thread has been wrong/or a poor interpretation by you. And people have responded, posting the *correct* charts even though you still insist they aren’t. Get outta here man
PMI is an index that combines both the manufacturing and services sectors. A decline in the PMI composite would indicate a contraction in overall economic activity, considering both manufacturing and services.
this data came out today, first of all.
[deleted]
you don’t understand what you’re talking about. post a screenshot of what you’re saying.
you read a guys comments and he deleted all of them after i corrected him and you’re trying to say i’m posting “incorrect charts” why don’t you learn something and read the article i wrote.
The PMI composite is above 50 (which I linked you) which using your own graphic means expansion.
I linked you the data. You linked not todays data.
Nah I’m good. You’ve proven yourself to be an utter regard and you know what, that’s a-okay!
please check again.  https://preview.redd.it/jk2lxoexns9b1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e62503a7ca5e74e0fa880f38f7a532769a1b542c
lol. loser.
I'm taking crazy pills.  WHAT IS THAT IN APRIL?!?!?! IT WENT UP UP UP UP UP UP UP!  YOUR GRAPH YOU LINKED SAYS CLEARLY COMPOSITE WHICH THIS ONE ISN'T
Dude literally every single retort you’ve made has been downvoted to all hell. Take a hint.
I SAID IT WAS IN CONTRACTION 8 STRAIGHT MONTHS RIETARD. CONTRACTION, NOT UP OR DOWN. WHO CARES IF ITS UP OR DOWN????
that doesn’t matter to me. in my opinion the people doing that bought the market at the top and they’re pissed. probably bought AAPL on Friday and Nvidia after April.   i know what i’m talking about. people who are serious about becoming someone on Wall Street, those who see the value and want to be able to understand data as it comes out and be able to parse through it with an all encompassing idea of what that data is saying. i’m here for them, and they’re the minority in this community of rietards.
You're actually regarded as a freaking stone. That's literally what those words mean. Down for 8 straight months.
You have no idea how many said AMDs 200 PE was too high. Now it trades at 500 PE. Anything is possible
Bc they can just stock split to 5 PE and make everyone happy!
AI is a fad,  that is like saying the internet and the smartphone were a fad
I think you should buy T-bills
Could go up could go down
Tech sector seems too bullish at the moment and I can’t see that stopping soon - I was a Nvidia bear until last Friday when price failed to break down to 400 and below, but now I’m just neutral :)
Right now if you placed a order for chips it may be some time before you get the delivery. There is a premium for what they are selling, there is ENORMOUS demand and little supply.  NVDA has their next earnings call in mid August. I think they will blow past expectations and raise guidance again. It may see $700.  AMD has earning in early August, should give us an idea of how things look before NVDA reports. Those that cant get chips with NVDA may be going to AMD.  The line is long to place your order.  I get it though, nobody like this rally. But if they grow into their earnings, its fairly valued.
A pull back to 375-400 would be like 5 or 10%. This happens with every ticker all the time.
Does anyone that really understands Nvidia’s business believe it can’t keep going up? They’re not just AI. They’ll power just about every emerging technology, autonomous vehicles, virtual simulations/modeling, omniverse, cloud computing, big ol’ data centers, crypto, gaming, and…. AI.   AI is only a small piece of their puzzle and AI has only begun to be socialized mainstream.  Nvidia will be larger than AAPL and TSLA.  They have a monopoly and are 5 years ahead of the competition.  If you don’t believe, watch this video:     https://youtu.be/PWcNlRI00jo
Buy when its being bullish. Sell when it's being bearish. Markets can be irrational longer than you can be solvent.
NVDA already failed to break down below $400 twice last week.  At this point, I think it is more likely to get to $450 before $400.
Market needed a catalyst to pump everything up for liquidity after a bad 2022. Can’t have all the money sidelined in cash at guaranteed 5-6%. No one gets bonuses. NVDA was a great ticker to fire up the fomo. AI has been around a long time. Sure it’s a great kickstart to move things along faster, but randomly having the market pick a few companies and double their value overnight is not sustainable. At some point, likely within the next couple earnings reports, there will be something that exposes the hype train was early and there will be some mighty bag holders. But it definitely won’t be the big boys holding them.
That was close to the number I landed on, but nvidia is priced based on their technology not so much on revenue.  This is the year of AI and nvidia is king in that market.  Until Wall Street moves on to the next big thing, nvidia will continue on its highs.
Take profit now, AMD has entered the game.
I agree. It's too early to claim NVDA is gonna be a winner in the AI hardware dept. They will definitely be a contender though.  If you want to invest in "shovels and pans", look at dutch lithography.
TSLA was up 6% today.
GALLIUM SHORTAGGGGGGGGGEEE!!!
Here is the catalyst: (Breaking News June 3, 2023)  China hits back with export curbs on chipmaking materials  https://www.ft.com/content/6dca353c-70d8-4d38-a368-b342a6450d95
Just don't buy puts, my put gets squeezed many times
Forward PE is "only" 40.   Doubling earnings again to justify that would be quite the feat. Could have some downside to correct but probably not as much as you think as you're looking backwards instead of forwards.
I said the about zoom during 2021. NVDA will come back to the 300 but when is the million dollar question and how high will it get.
[a fad like EVs](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1371599/global-ev-market-share/)
![img](emote|t5_2th52|29637)![img](emote|t5_2th52|29637)![img](emote|t5_2th52|29637)
No other way to bypass NVDA computing power  They spend lots of time on software and hardware stack.
Because?
Timing the downfall of theses things always difficult. I think the AI hype has to die off first. I tried puts on NVDA and got wrecked once already.   I may try once more, but I am stalking subs like r/singularity . When the hype dies there I will know we may be getting close to a bubble pop. You don’t have to read far down that sub to realize that the hype is still completely irrational
This is why I only buy shares. It’s so much easier. I think people get way to nitty gritty with the evaluations. A 15 vs 20 P/E ratio for the last quarter, who cares.   I’ve owned NVDA for like 8 years and 95% of the time I thought it was overvalued. But I also have thought that that they will fundamentally be a stronger company in 10 years than when I bought them. Good companies trade at a premium because they are premium.   I really don’t think 25% differences in under vs overvalued matters if you look long term
Complete madness who tha fk buying 200pe … absolute trash
NVDA is probably the best AI play. I'd be surprised if it tested 375 after increasing their guidance by 4 billion. They'd have to miss on earnings badly or China would have to invade Taiwan for that to happen imho. The pull back was short lived and there may be some more but I feel it'll be minimal
I got such a strong gut reaction to this that I’m going to buy 50k in shares on market open.   It might be the beers, but the gut never lies.
AMD's GAAP PE is 643. AMD's Non-GAAP PE is only 38.5. It's nowhere near as overvalued as NVidia.
A couple of differences between AMD and NVDA...  * AMD is basically not in the AI market but is trying to break in and as such there may be greater AI growth (percentage wise) than NVDA  * AMD is arguably more diversified especially with the recent purchases - ie CPUs, GPUs, field programmable ... - than NVDA  * NVDA is the current standard for the hardware and the API portion of the AI stack  Does that justify the higher PE? Maybe not.  But we are coming from an era of price to sales or even price to TAM so you could say that it is more reasonable than those companies.
Just because something trades at 500 doesn’t mean it should.  AMD will regress to the mean.
Wsb maths at its finest ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Huh?
&#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/q1258zi0ts9b1.jpeg?width=990&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ae5fae51675008d591ed9e0a7e4a86bdd5c001e5
idk, i heard C-bills comin back ![img](emote|t5_2th52|31249)
Lol. Buy high, sell low? You had the opportunity to be a successful bear all the way down to 112.
Sounds like time for NVDA calls
Nvidia definitely has reasons to support a high valuation.  But $1T+? I don't know.
Why Nvda GPU will be affected by gallium shortage?
Come on. You complain about 200 PE and suddenly have a justification for 500?
You two are looking at lagging indicators.  AMD has a P/E of 480 but a forward P/E of 40  NVDA has a P/E of 220 but a forward P/E of 52  Assuming they really do match expectations of course. The idea is that they can continue this growth until suddenly its a P/E of like 0.5 at today's price.  Still overvalued as shit but that's the explanation.
True but it can get there.
I would imagine its a joke but I can't be too sure these days
Putting Clifford on blast there
Clifford had a gas of a good time on the internet !
They don't need to be justified because they don't mean anything. 1 year P/E (forward or historical) is not significant in a rapidly developing industry.
Realistically, would you want to place your bets on a company with a single product line or one with multiples even with a higher PE?  The single product line company, no matter how good that single product is, is at a higher risk of someone coming along and disrupting it's sole market.  A company with multiple product lines can still be disrupted but for the company to have big issues, multiple disruptions have to happen.
How does forward P/E go up when their revenues are trending down?
Forward PE is just wishful thinking
With regards to AI, I really believe that the revenue for both Nvidia and AMD will be lumpy every quarter if not a one time bump.  Once the major AI model developers have their compute clusters with enough compute, I don't see sustained revenue for Nvidia continue long term.  I'm sure there will be newer generations of compute platforms but I'm not sure that will continue to drive sustainable quarterly revenues.  Seen this with crypto miners and Nvidia. People forget the crypto hardware business for Nvidia was very lumpy and they had to dance around the issue every earnings call.

no idea but maybe they had a major 1 time loss or goodwill impairment or increased profit margins
Partly true. Companies do generally give pretty good estimates.
There is always more compute
Jesus it is a slow day here with bears digging their Graves and bulls on yatch made of pure money enjoying life.  I am at work like a fucking moron.

There you go you said it yourself. Not positive. So how much did you lose now you are coming out? I hope it was alot. I have a disdain for tesla short sellers and thay rat chicken genius who is currently hiding in a cave after the inverse chicken ETF launched 🤣😅
I double dare him. So i can buy cheaper 🤣

No, didn't yolo. Not thaaaat stupid.
Mistake, it was -net-. Corrected already.
At what point do you go net negative? 🤔🤔 Surely if your positive now is the time to get out? Genuine question here. I don't do shorting as its far too risky for my tastes.
It's too late, up to this point, there's more probability of it coming down than keep going up. But let me be clear, it's a probability, I have absolutely no certainty.
Guess we are about to find out in a min how the weekend news effects the price. I really should read into shorting and how it works just never wanted to have the risk. Buy and hold or leave alone was always nice and simple to me 🤔🤔
RIP
That might get you a comfortable retirement, but not butthole cocaine parties in a yacht.
I'm still alive, bitch.
Bold of you to assume I don't already have a lot of butthole cocaine partys 😜😜 fyi feds reading I don't even know what cocaine is , is it a type of candy?? 😊😊 My other game plan is YOLO on tesla as clearly its "to the moon " from this DD 👌👌 cant loose clearly.

If you played Mortal Kombat: choose your destiny.  Tesla the company that will electrify the world or the overvalued CAR company.
I knew that since premarket. Still positive. Too late to sell the news for me.
You too.
I wish there was a future score board everyone take a side and lock in then come back in five years see who came out on top 🤣 but whichever way it goes no one will admit they chose the loosing side. I guess I could buy stonks and short the stock 🤔🤔 both win and loose at same time
No shit
Nokia? Now that's a name I haven't heard in a long time. I loved the snake game.
NOK NOK
I remember when we had NOK gang in 2020 saying to buy 2023 calls
Time to upgrade my Nokia brick to a 5G powerhouse!
There is a huge upside possible in NOK. It just need to make public aware that they are not the company making the nokia phones. Some stupid people still judges their performance based on how those nokia phone made by a totally different company is doing.   Current nokia is a tech giant working in the same space as Ericsson or Huawei for making networking equipment or software.
It’ll go up 2 cents. Nokia hasn’t moved in 2 years
Looks like Nokia's making a comeback, taking us all back to the good ol' days of Snake and indestructible phones! 🐍📞
Investing in Nokia? Now that's a connection worth dialing for! 📞🚀
Wow I've got a 3310 and a 5210 that still work. The 5210 probably still has 30% battery 😂
Nice try. I already fell for this one years ago.
I was looking at Nokia phones the other day and their flagship one isn’t even bad. It’s got a 64 megapixel camera and it’s only $499.
Is this still a tikr?
Nokia gang rise up!
Keep on eye this stock. It will go up very soon.
Who's there?
…to the moon…
i lost during that correct
You do realize how many outstanding shares there are correct?  You do realize what it takes to move this slug
I bought in 2015, its been sideways since, most stable stock :/
Cook
Yes. That is a huge number. But they are actively trying to improve the situation with share buyback worth $600M .   But the main reason I think Nokia can progress is because they have an existing large portfolio of 5G equipment and software. Within the next 2-3 years telecom operators of many developing nations will start upgrading their system. Huge business boost is possible during that period. Disclaimer: I work in this domain.
Cook who?

My buddy from California that’s in the millwright union just got contracted to make 50k for 2 months of work in Texas at one of the Tesla factories  Idk if they’re having trouble finding skilled labor in Texas but they seem desperate
Sure, but their market cap is 829B
You're comparing income without mentioning the difference in marketcap/multiple. Stellantis trades at a P/E of 3. Volkswagen 5. Tesla 77. Obviously tesla is growing faster, doesnt mean the market isn't already pricing it for perfection.  Also, just like every single tesla fanboy ever, you people cant seem to read legacy car company balance sheets and keep coming up with these absurd debt figures for these businesses. News flash: the vast majority of that debt is a net *receivable* because these companies operate huge and profitable leasing arms.
If model 3 highland refresh isn’t major they will continue to massively lose ground in China. Competition here is fierce and cars are constantly updated, meanwhile model 3 still looks like it did 5 years ago.
There are other EV companies?
My 2 cents withonimal research is the common charging  is going to hurt Tesla I'm the long run. That was the one thing going for them that differentiated them . I was hesitantt to buy a rivian or lucid because the lack of charging stations  Now the moat for superchargers is less viable. Tesla owners getting pissed they gotta wait for everyone  else at these charging stations  Not going to short it yet though
Lol. Keep on pumping your calls!
I'm not sure why we even need a discussion like this. If Ford and GM we're leaders, they wouldn't be making a deal with Tesla to use their charging stations.  Tesla will be ahead of everyone for probably the next 10 years. I still think Ford will become the 2nd in EVs and I think VW will be 3rd. GM could take 4th but I'm not confident. Their attempts at EVs are laughable. It's almost as if they don't really want to build EVs. (Please don't say the Hummer is a contender.)  This all by say 2030.  Even still, why are we even discussing this? Tesla is so far ahead, no one is even close to catching up.  Unless the EV market dries up, I don't see a world without Teslas and without Tesla being #1 in EVs for the foreseeable future.  Not a fanboy. Don't own a Tesla. Actually pretty big fan of anything with a diesel in it. And have no positions in Tesla. I just calls it how I sees it. An opinion of a true regard.
Enough talks just tell me when it will hit $420.69 please.
I read that if you jerk off or fool around with a girl in your Tesla the car will record a video and upload it directly to Pornhub.   All of these videos are saved to a playlist that Elon uses as his spank bank.
Yeah, Tesla is here to stay, when anyone thinks of EV's it's always been a tesla and always will be there's no beating someone like Elon who has hundreds of millions of people who love him.
in musk we trust
I just bought some tesla stock because I remembered that time elon said dont invest in tesla
Audi and Volvo make some really nice EVs now too
Calling Ford and GM "big players" in the EV or even the regular car business is your first mistake. Big players are VW, Toyota and some Chinese and maybe South Korean car companies.
Good enough for me. 1000 puts please and thank you.
what most likely will happen is you will end up driving some Chinese EV while your wife and her boyfriend will drive a Model S
Kind of missing the bear's points here. Let's do one more comparison to justify the stock price.  Market cap  Ford: 60 billion Gm: 53 billion Tesla: 820 billion  No one is arguing that Tesla's growth isn't good and impressive, but it's simply not worth that.  Hell, Toyota makes more in like 1-2 months then Tesla does all year and their market cap is like 200billion
DD from a guy who didn't even capitalise Tesla in the heading and uses emojis  Bless wsb
In China they're already behind BYD.

Tesla's sales grew 202.5x in those 10 years. Projecting another 10 years, that 81 billion in sales will be a STAGGERING 16.5 TRILLION! That's more sales than most countries' economies.
Tesla makes shit cars.
Really only 2 reasons EV buyers are not buying Tesla.    Not "luxury" enough and/or a personal hatred toward Musk.
As much as I’d hate to agree I think OP may be right. Tesla is fucking killing it. Their growth is off the charts.  I don’t really understand why people have this weird obsession with the Tesla brand. Build quality is junk for how much you have to spend to get one, but the Tesla branding is so damn powerful for some reason.
I really really doubt tesla will remain in their position unless their new car will be perfect. The competition who actually knows how to make cars that are not just glorified gadgets with misaligned panels and squeaky interior is catching up and already now offering alternatives that are better in any way. Also the styling on tesla's side wont help and the coolness factor is limited to some specific groups, funny enough bankers, financial people and similar are among these groups so you may be biased due to this. Outside of that group a tesla is just a douche car with bland styling.
who are these tesla bears and what are they talking about? I think lot of these Tesla bears have stopped talking about two years ago IMO.
I agree. There’s lots more upside with Optimus, Dojo and FSD.
Woah am intelligent post? What happened here? Welcome!
This guy is right we’re the  cyber truck comes out?
price drop and rebates pushing sales. Uglyass cars but model y is one of the cheapest EV right now so no wonder people are buying it. Next year will be tough, lots of competition coming in.
To be clear GM and Ford products are two of the worst cars in the world. I see only Toyota possibly beating Tesla in the long run than GM, Ford, Chrysler, Fiat and all other American bullshit car companies together.
Tesla will be the new leading US auto manufacturer. It has a bright future dying a slow death at the hand of unions and Asian manufacturers with cheaper cost base.
Your comparison is gas vs EV. Doesn't it stand to reason the OG companies will take some margin compression in the short term to retool to supply EV's?
Doesn't Tesla suck out all the driving/camera/sensor data from their cars?
Instead of comparing Tesla to 2 companies that the US government won’t let fail (bail out bail in, whatever the cool kids call it these days), how about compare Tesla to Toyota?
Ha! When will the Tesla 🏳️‍🌈🐻 ever learn. They love losing money. Just like Michael Burry.   Yeah getting buried 6 feet under. This isn’t what you want.   ***Siri, please play “I wanna rock” by Lil Uzivert*** 🗣️
plugin hybrids offer the best of all worlds. toyota knows this and would rather make 5 cars with a realistic daily range than one electric car using the same amount of batteries.
Becuase of the Tesla cult followers, thats the reason
I have finally seen some Teslas around where I live. They make Azteks look attractive. Bulls will get excited when Tesla delivers 500k cars for free. They are begging people to buy these cars.
I’m not sure… volvo’s new electric range is better looking, better build quality, just as fast, just as much range, and works out cheaper than the equivalent mode Y.   Tesla puts.
What about the man child CEO.
Move over, Ford and GM! Tesla is here to drive us to the future!
OP is ignoring the fact that Tesla is losing overall marketshare in the EV sector.  Tesla for a while had basically a monopoly on high end, long range EV's so they dominated the market.  That isn't the case anymore.  Solid offerings from like a dozen companies now.  Tesla is very slow to pivot and scale.  They will crumble.
Teslas are shit built. Good luck making your money tho
I guess we'll have to start calling them TesLOYALists! 🚀
Just wait until Papa Elon starts selling stock as early as next year. He’s prolly itching right now to sell some but has to keep “his word”.
Tesla is like apple with the iPhone: there’s one iPhone with 50% of the market and 100 androids cumulatively make up the other 50%.
U have to be insane to drive that overpriced fancy golf cart
ya till other companies start using solid state batteries like next year and and really up the game. the only thing long term tesla has is they built the infrastucter for chargers and everyone is adapting to them. tesla is never going to beat old records.
The news reported that BYD cleaned Tesla’s clock in China and is coming to the US. BYD is backed by Warren Buffett
Can we get a hover car too!
They should cap the amount of drives the Tesla can do based if youre a registered driver, unregistered driver or newly made unregistered driver
Pretty sure GM has the Tesla takeover plan ready to go at a moment’s notice.
No shit, enough said. I’m not even reading your post lol
Elon is putting up crazy numbers. Which is weird cause I personally don’t know anyone who is buying a tesla in 2023.
Tesla stonks will get crushed when US and EU governments start to require manufacturers to recycle EV lithium batteries (not landfill in the desert) or at least pay a third party for recycling. This is an unsolved problem that Tesla is creating and massively contributing right now. Millions of Model 3 batteries will need to get swapped out within the next 5-7 years.
Thanks just bought puts
If tesla cant up their quality they will lose it all in the long run.
I feel like the success of Tesla is in spite of Elon rather than because of him but ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
What a joke! The op who made this post doesn’t realize how mentally unstable Elon Musk is not to mention the fact he thinks Telsa will be the only EV maker. He can’t even run a social media company he’s already ran into the ground what makes you think he can keep Telsa floating. Once other car companies catch up Telsa will be wiped off the map
Be toast without subsidies
I agree that SC network will do well.  Buuuuut, Tesla vehicle quality is SHIT as is their service.  Opening up their network will just accelerate their loss of market share for vehicles. After I finally sell my MX and MS, i will gladly buy EV from a reputable automaker and use their charging network.  As far as Q2, the hit that # only after ?8? Price cuts this year.  Their margin is going into the gutter.  Big Auto can afford losses for a lot longer than Tesla can.    Before you go off about the $20B cash / ~0 debt for Tesla, look at the balance sheet again, especially their short term liabilities.  Literally all that cash is offset by AP, etc.  It's too bad Tesla didn't license their tech years ago and just switch to energy.  Far less headache and the money is in the recurring revenue anyway.
Elon= Asshole. Ford and GM are going to pass Tesla in sales for EV and Tesla will incur more debt. Tesla becoming the standard for chargers is what will save Tesla in the long run.
For how many of these years was Tesla the only option for an EV vehicle? Now with more companies offering EV cars, even the German ones, the competition is getting much higher and Tesla will no doubt be impacted.  Oh and let's not forget the coming Margin squeeze when the Chinese EVs flood the market
I think they will continue to be the EV leader also due to European cars now switching to hydrogen.   BMW has a small fleet of hydrogen vehicles being tested around the world. 5 minutes to fill up, over 300 miles in range.   Volkswagen has cut back EV production, sales aren't there, could they too be going to hydrogen?
I agree with most everything you presented except I am concerned about the fake truck (cyber truck).  It is not a truck and will not perform like a truck.  The buyers of this fake truck better like the novelty of it.
You are missing a few things:  1: Tesla vehicles are terrible quality vehicles. Always have and to this day still do rank among the lowest quality vehicles you can buy. Touch screen issues, missing paint, missing features, interior paneling with gaps and some things just not installed at all. And Tesla is still having issues with these things  2: Teslas are just now starting to get onto the used car market, and the trend will only increase over the next few years. And with the requirement to buy a new battery, and with the previously mentioned quality issues, I suspect these will sell for much cheaper than when the original owners bought them.   3: Although this secondary market may be great for the brand, it does nothing for Tesla’s bottom line. And because of their price-point for the poor quality and increased competition on the market, Tesla will indeed lose some of their original adopters to competitors with better quality and reliability. We already see this forcing them to cut prices.   I’m not a bear on the company, but this valuation is absurd. Don’t get caught with your pants down.
This post misses the biggest issue with Tesla. Their cars have not changed the way they look in what over ten years? Once GM and Ford are pumping out EV’s they’re going to be doing their model updates all the time like we currently do. I also saw some stats somewhere that a very low percentage of Tesla owners buy another Tesla. Mainly cause the quality is so low. With GM Ford and VW adding quality made and fresh vehicles to their EV lineups… I just don’t see the Elon Dan boys being enough. Only good point you made is with the chargers. The domestic companies are stupid to get in bed with their competitor at all.
The majority of sales of Teslas are inferior products that people have already stopped buying.  They have overexpanded and most people are realizing that they want a quality product instead.  There are both cheaper and higher quality competitors and the amount of competition will only increase with time.  Teslas stock is at a valuation that assumes they will continue to expand forever and be the only option in the industry.  Eventually that paradigm will change and Elon will have already sold at the top again and holders will be fucked.
When apple releases its car it’s over for Tesla , they always wait longer but do it properly
No doubt about that baby. Elon to the moon, the rest of you can worship him
bobby is that you?  or too soon to ask? ![img](emote|t5_2th52|31249)
i only buy byd stonk tyvm
Not saying you're wrong but you have to be careful of your assertions about their margins. Tesla had lower profitability in Q1 23 compared to Q4 22 even as they had more sales. Q2 23 could continue the trend of lower profitability but higher sales.   We will know more when they report.
For me the most important factor of Tesla is Kwasses the supercharger network. It’s just so much better than everything else. The rest doesn’t even com close and that’s the most important thing for actually using an ev.
Lol... who even needs this post right now? Everybody else already shit the bed in this department right?
Tell me you’ve never rode in a Tesla without telling me
Is this supposed to be a hot take? 🤷🏼‍♂️
we know what happens every time wsb agrees what direction a stock goes.. poots all the way
Ford but not GM?
Tesla margins will be hammered as soon as it becomes clear that their (massively over priced) FSD is pretty well worthless.  Key US markets are already saturated. Doing well in EUR at the moment, but that'll change later this year as supply of competitor vehicles eases up. High volume to stay in China but reducing market share - they're too expensive for the mass market.  Puts down to $350bn market cap.....the only question is, when?
TSLA pre-market is looking rather lovely.
Blah blah fucking blah
Didn’t Tesla drop their price big time this year? That seems like a low margin play
Just keep in mind the „dominant“ is North America only. They are still leading globally, but not as much as in the US.
You do know the current valuation of these companies are not the same right? To deliver decent risk adjusted returns over time Tesla needs to grow considerably.
In the UK, in the past few months I have witnessed what I would call an exponential rise in the number of Teslas I see on the road.  I believe they are also something of a status symbol over here, though I don't know why.  I think Teslas are the new Audis in that respect maybe.
Bro - it’s priced to replace every function on earth.
I mean.. the deliveries did happen because of insane price cuts OP which is good for now but long term is a different story. It will still be dominant though in the short term for sure.
Whenever margins come up in this debate, people seem to ignore (or be unaware of) the fact that GM intentionally sells their EVs at a loss. They're not trying to make a profit on them yet. They're financing their EV expansion with a successful $10 billion ICE business.  Comparing margins in this case is absolutely nonsensical.  Whatever you think of Tesla vs GM, at least have a basic understanding of their business models.
The competition is coming ?  lol.
Say it with me, slowly:  Past  Results  Do not  Predict  Future  Performance
Leaving Toyota off of your comparison list is an interesting choice
As someone in the market for a new car the Tesla model 3 on now on par with a Toyota Prius after all the dealer markups
Auto sales might end up being a very marginal piece of Tesla revenue, and that might be the best case thing for the company.
They're a growth company that sees saturation on the horizon (they have no way to meaningfully increase the # of car buyers) with a PE ratio still something like 10x-20x of their competition that's hit that saturation point.     As far as growth and cars on the road they'll do fine.  But market cap wise I see more risk than reward long term.
Lol these posts pop up when a stock has a massive run up, but none of you MF’s had anything to say last January
if its so good then just shut up and hold lol
What do you think of Mullen Automotive?
A Tesla is the car that people say wow if you have. No one cares is you have a bmw anymore.
I’ve said this since 2014, and now I’m a millionaire thanks to TSLA. We will easily see the TSLA triple within the next 5 years.
Europeans and Asia have caught up and have better made and performance cars now.  Tesla is moving into the supply market with its plug in agreements my feeling is Tesla will be a minority ev supplier in 10 years.
The reason why you see those tremendous profits is due to high gross margins which they are sacrificing for higher sales so profits might actually come down while sales go up. If the company was on sale for $200 billion this would not be an issue. Its almost 1 trillion in value - risk reward is crazy high for Tesla at this point. I would stay clear.
They’re also finally about to roll out their cyber trucks which they have 1.25 MILLION presales for. Everyone thought this wouldn’t be for awhile. They can basically make as many of them as they want and have guaranteed buyers.  I don’t think this cash flow has been priced into the current stock price. This things going to moon so hard when the cyber truck starts rolling out.
what does it really matter? EV don't mean anything. nobody cares about car companies why u think ford and GM are never pumping. it's all just Elon hype over self driving taxis and people thinking batteries are going to save the environment. EV are nothing but a trend in a dying market. we don't need more cars on the road. we don't need more factories pumping them out.
You are right on the money! Thank you for justifying the $400 per share valuation that I estimate Tesla is worth 👍
This is Apples to Oranges.  Ford and GM aren't making those $$$ selling EVs.  They have more pain ahead.
Tesla is the ultimate AI company, maybe by 2028 things will become obvious.
This reads like chatGPT
Dumb
Toyota was the leading auto seller in the USA for 2022, how do they stack up this year?
LMAO keep dreaming 🤣 You really think people outside the US will keep buying Teslas when there are more and more european options coming in the next years. Only idiots pay premium for an inferiour product…
Tell me you're an American, living in a mirrored bubble without.....
I’m forklift certified working in a GM factory I wonder if they’ll pay me the big bucks. I’ll probably blow it all on spy 0dte options though…
Lack of skilled labor in Texas?  Who could’ve possibly predicted that?
 Desperate times call for desperate Teslas. They'll do whatever it takes to keep those factories running smoothly
Bullllllllish
SHITsla up 6% premarket 5am EST monday july 3rd... calls hella printing
What kind of work does he do? (Millwright?)
Might seem like a lot but to move from cali->texas for a 2month job and have nothing more from them after that it's not amazing. Travelling nurses were making 8k+ a week or 64k+/2 months a while back. They are still hitting 50k/2 months atm.
50k for 2 months sounds about right working 7/12's. Probably less hours than that with California scale.
Skilled labor ain’t cheap and cheap labor ain’t skilled.
Isn’t Elon trying to develop a boom town for mining in Texas or something?
rubbing my wet bulb just thinking about it
....Who's in the millwright union
So what, go research Tesla’s energy products. Megapack sells for 2 million and the inflation reduction act subsidizes a large portion of the cost.
Tesla will be a 10 trillion dollar stock. 829 Billion is nothing.
You ignore the debt those others companies hold and the fact that most of their capital invested is in tech that is fading.  Tesla also has other business avenues, charging infrastructure, energy, battery development, eventually one day robots could make a ton of money.
If major countries and unions (aka EU) are switching to EVs only by 2035, the collateral value for that huge debt (aka ICE vehicles) is going to plummet and that debt will be a big drag on legacy OEMs.  Ford may split off Ford Blue and leave it with all the debt to keep Ford Model e successful.
Yeah generally companies where people are running for the exits are also not super sustainable in my view.  People in automotive know that Tesla is a hodgepodge of equipment because they go with the lowest bidder and contractors quit or get kicked out when things don't work.  "Big 3 car maker" has much better benefits and our operators can still cling to a "middle class" life if they were hired in more than 5 years ago.
Newsflash the media doesn’t cover Tesla’s other products which the company states will bring in more business than the cars.
Yeah we're starting to get alot of the BYDs in Australia. They're Chinese made 5 year warranty blah blah and are half the price of a Tesla and still get the same government subsidies for the consumer. It's kinda of a no brainer for the bulk of the population looking to go electric
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SEfwoqKRU8
Tesla will go up and down, but the "c0mPeTiON iS cOMinG" bros are consistent
Agree, internal needs a refresh
News flash the rate at which tesla has updated their model 3 outside of looks is faster than any car company in history.
Gm claims to be the ev leader. Biden agreed and didn't bother to jnvite Tesla to their first few ev talks..  Then let's not forget how they were pushing hard to promote legacy with higher rebates if the car was produced with union labor.
You‘d be surprised how many fully electric Hyundais, Kias, VW, Audis, even Jags you see over here in Europe.   In fact, VW sells more pure EVs in Europe than Tesla - 350‘000 units vs 230‘000 units. And Stellantis sells the same number as Tesla. It’s just spread over more models, so less noticeable.   https://www.electromaps.com/en/blog/europes-best-selling-electric-vehicles-2022  Food for thought.
I visited Southern California recently and I feel like every other car I see if a Tesla. It’s insane
Mostly Chinese market where they sell a ton
Gm, ford, rivian may give slight competitiveness to tesla
They are no where near
[deleted]
Every other big car maker, yes.
This is correct. Most people, myself included, bought Tesla in the past over other EVs just for the infrastructure. Road-trips took little to no planning because the SC network is/was extensive (in the EU at least). For the same amount of money I can now buy a higher quality vehicle and access the same charging network. I live in Norway, this was the Tesla playground for years, and as charging has become easier they are losing their appeal and foothold in the market. I imagine the same will happen in many other countries now that more companies can take advantage of the network.
Tesla doesn’t want the whole pie. Tesla wants a smaller slice of a much much larger pie.   Bringing more carmakers into NACS grows the pie.   If I had to guess, they might have some consumer research that shows that getting people into ANY EV has a higher likelihood of getting them into a Tesla eventually than letting them stay ICE and maybe never consider Tesla. I mean, if you are buying a BEV you have to at least LOOK at Tesla’s specs and price, right? If you are buying a Challenger you don’t.
How many long trips do you actually do? Most charging occurs at home.
Well they continue to build the supercharging network, don’t forget tesla will get certain percentage from all these ev makers so it can add up to their cash pile
 Elon just got totally outsmarted by people who have been in the car business for 120 years.  The charging networks will eventually be taken over by oil companies who already have most of the infrastructure in place. Here in Australia the Tesla network is almost non-existent and chargers are being installed in regular petrol stations.
Tesla will make money from charging and everybody will constantly see how much better Tesla tech is vs other charging infrastructure. Other brands are not allowed to use the full network.
This isn’t a definite. Part of the reason Tesla is opening up the network is to receive government funding. That same funding could be used to throttle construction of their charging network.
True visual mod
Good VisualMod, good
Join the tesla gang, we are headed to ath 🚀🚀🚀🚀
Chinese and maybe Hyundai/Kia will take the next spots, GM and Ford will not sell any meaningful numbers outside North-America, this is about the world, not one continent.
End of the year
Yup by next year q2 🚀🚀
And no one is buying them because Tesla's are cheap.
There certainly is competition in tech and quality but they are still too expensive. It seems as if the big players still want to get rid of their combustion engines.
They weigh an absurd amount and their efficiency and charging is atrocious.  Their cargo capacity is also ridiculous for the size of the car compared to Tesla.  All this is enough to prefer Tesla, then you look at price and tech and it's no contest. The only reason people buy volvo is emotion, not logic, but the vast majority of people prefer to buy the best even if there's many around. There's a reason why model Y is the best selling car worldwide.
They are not, not when it comes to BEV's.  They are worldwide leader and leading in China when it comes to electric cars (those that don't have an ICE).

You know what they say, beauty is in the eye of the keyholder
I’ve owned mine for almost 5 years, not a SINGLE problem. My GM car before this one, that was a mess.
I was sure I was going to buy a Model S until I drove the Audi e-Tron GT.  Tesla has better range and price, but the cars feel cheap compared to Audi.  Idc that Musk is a hero to alt-right incels, but many people do.
Also because they lied about FSD and I’m just waiting to see who wins that race
Ill go with 3: too volatile due to years of lies.
No. I wanted an EV truck.
Have you looked at the exterior or interior? Yyuuucckkk. Definitely best specs though
True, analysts & news outlet continue to ignore & doesn’t give enough credit for tesla
You better bet on the Germans!
Yeah and it just sounds uncool. I’ve never heard of a young person saying “hey check out my new GM or new Ford!”
Forget legacy car makers. The competition is the Chinese pure EV manufacturers like BYD.
This is a moronic take, its purely because of their massive advantage in every aspect of their business.
Who gives a pussy fuck, he's making me rich and you're still poor
> OP is ignoring the fact that Apple is losing overall marketshare in the smartphone sector. Apple for a while had basically a monopoly on high end, touchscreen smartphones so they dominated the market. That isn't the case anymore. Solid offerings from like a dozen companies now. Apple is very slow to pivot and scale. They will crumble.  agreed
A lot of EV's are now adopting Tesla's superchargers, Model Y and Model 3 are still one of the best selling vehicles, Cybertruck preorders are extremely high, Tesla ain't going anywhere.
suuuuuuuuure:  [https://www.counterpointresearch.com/global-smartphone-share/](https://www.counterpointresearch.com/global-smartphone-share/)
Shitbox, still pricey but cheaper than others.
Lol. Solid state batteries are at least 3-5 years away from mass market.
I’m not too worried about that. Uncle Sam have a tendency to ban any Chinese company that competes against US special interests. Call it a national security risk or something about human rights and BYD would be banned before their first car ever touches US soil. Tesla will remain an undisputed EV leader in the U.S.
Not unsolved, but needs to be improved. Not worth pursuing right now because of economies of scaling. The recycling phase will make Tesla even more profitable (as also other EV companies). It's much more expensive to extract Lithium, Nickel and other materials in low concentration than recycling.
do you think SpaceX would have started the era of reusable rockets, and got Starlink up sooner without him too ?
Without balls, my uncle would be my aunt
A company that has absolutely no experience or infrastructure to build cars will compete with others that are having a hard time to do it.
going out like a real man
They give you 1 share of tsla when you start but you have to stay a year.
Anyone but Texans
What am I missing here? Business moves to Texas in droves, it has seen some of the highest population growth over the last 10 years, and is the 2nd most moved to state. What about that leads to a lack of skilled labor?
anyone with a working braincell is leaving that cesspool
Texas is a boom, probably lack of workers not skill.
Texas ain’t no Florida.
The need more Chines H1B visas.
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millwright
Millwright put stuff in place   Precision Millwright put stuff in place with micrometer and calculator   Source: I'm a Pipefitter
Put together equipment, like conveyor belts
It is a lot and hospitals were super desperate for nurses during the pandemic  He’s also getting housing+ per diem on top of the 50k. Normal rate for him is high 50s/hr and I’d guess Texas millwright rate is high 30s/hr
No shit but he normally makes 58$/hr which is 116k a year before OT. He’s going to make almost half his annual salary in 1/6th of the time while getting a hotel room and per diem on top of the 50k  So either Texas has a huge shortage of skilled labor or they’re trying to increase production for a short window
I have researched.. energy growth will be exponential not linear. And teslas mega pack growth will not be limited to just the US.
> 829 Billion is nothing.  How many hundreds of billions do you have to spare?
So Tesla will be larger than Microsoft meta apple Google Amazon nvidia and every automaker combined? Lmfao
I totally agree but not in the short term!! Certainly by 2030!!

Tesla offers wages above automotive industry in every country they produce cars, their benefits are also at minimum on par, in the most cases better.
tHe MeDiA dOeSnT cOvEr  > which the company states will bring in more business than the cars  No shit  1. All companies tend to be bullish on their own company  2. Elon has literally never been overly optimistic about anything ever /s.   3. Im not writing a bullcase on OEMs or a bearcase on tesla. Im just pointing out why this post is dogshit.  4. You better fucking hope there will be alternative revenue streams as the market is already pricing in at least a quintupling of profit before growth slows down.

Talking about software updates over the air?
Biden? Lol
True, this GM was bailed out earlie, carries a lot of debt but news media keep praising on how GM & ford is the ev leader, it’s laughable
Internal bureaucracy within vw its associated brands an German resistance to change  is well documented and a huge obstacle. Asian brands will most likely push them out
Western europes population on wiki is 165 mil. US alone is 331 million on wiki. EV/car dominance is more important US
There's a difference between people buying TSLA and driving them, and some car renting agencies in Germany and Europe having to buy from VW but nobody ain't driving them
It was sarcasm. Thanks for taking the time to help educate though.
They don’t call the Model 3 the California Camry for nothing
Drive for 15 minutes in Irvine and you will count atleast 50 white teslas.   But I’ve also started seeing all kinds of other electric cars slowly increasing in numbers. Specifically rivian.
I'm a Switzerland ATM and 1 in every 10 car is a Tesla now
I think Ford and Rivian are going after the truck and van market where you just don’t see Tesla. I wish Toyota would put out an EV already because I think they would crush sales with their great reputation on reliability.
Didn’t they all conform to making their luscious lip energy receptacles to fit Teslas energy ramming rod though?
U forget bmw

Thanks for the joke chatgpt
It's not the trip it's the perception that if I ever need a quick charge I can find a reliable.network quickly, instead of finding inconsistent charging stations
The exact opposite. It means EV owners will be able to charge anywhere making the Tesla/supercharger ecosystem much less valuable.  The oil companies will then install huge numbers of industry standard fast chargers in existing petrol stations (it is already happening on a large scale here in Australia).
But won't Tesla own the patent on the charger and get paid for it?
JIm right with you but be careful of the inversion in the  money market, that shit hits everything is crashing!!
I might. Will wait after JPow releases the interest hike beast!
What are you smoking man
your getting downvoted, but shitSLA up 6% premarket... this rally has even turned ME into a SHITsla bull...  and sadly i've had to give up my chairman of the board of director, CEO, and president, positions at the internationale association of shitSLA bears club federation
My opinion, those ranks are world numbers. Ford will do meaningful numbers. I truly believe that.  GM won't though. I don't see it. The hummer is like saying, hey lets build the heaviest EV possible. EV buyers love the biggest, heaviest, most horse power, most useless EV possible.  (Dear GM share holders, WTF are you on to believe in what GM is up to? Do you like getting pissed in the face? Mary is literally dropping turds in your cereal and you're like, "this is the best cereal ever.")  Ford has what Tesla doesn't. A legit electric truck that can be used as a truck. Rivian isn't a contender. Too much of a car. The buyers for a Rivian are not the same as the F150 Lightening. Rivian will either go bust or get bought up long term if you ask me. Ford also has an electric van. Sure there are others but they don't have the Ford service network. The key to winning the EV war will be in government and commercial contracts. Ford will get those. Ford probably won't win the sexiest EV. But they will win the working side of EVs. Tesla won't. VW probably won't. GM sure as hell won't. FCA/RAM won't (unless they got an ace card I've not seen yet), all the other brands don't have the interest or abilities to compete on that level.  A Chinese brand could take 4th. I don't see them coming to the US and dominating. They will take other countries though. So they might take VWs spot but I don't see it. Brand recognition is going to be key. Dealer network is also important.  Hyundai/KIA. I don't see it. They will fight for 6th at best.
End of month
For a model 3 sure.  Outside of that Tesla isn't very competitive.
Imagine linking that moron.
My understanding is that the problems with factory new teslas are in line with every other factory new car.
That’s a lie.
Their reliability ratings are poor af and I see a fuckton of used ones available. You got lucky but a whole lot of people are not.
He never said GM made good cars
I test drove BMW i4, Tesla Y and Nissan Leaf on your typical Japanese roads (basically a patchwork of cheap repairs and potholes, only central Tokyo has nice roads).   The suspensions on the Tesla are so bad that I cut it short because I was getting pack pain after 10 minutes of driving. BMW was a perfectly smooth experience and the Leaf felt a bit rough but nowhere close the uncomfort level of a Tesla. No wonder I have never seen a single Tesla in Japan (this is not a stretch, I have never seen a single one on the road) but I see Leafs on a daily basis and BWMs a few times a week.  Went for the Leaf. It doesn't pretend to be a luxury car but it was certainly more comfortable than the Tesla and it was cheaper. In term of design, Tesla is not minimalist, it's just bare-bone.  Also, screw touch panels, I want physical buttons to operate my car while I drive.  Tesla may stay dominant in America mostly thanks to its range but it doesn't have much appeal in the rest of the world.
So you bought another EV?
Germany is fucked with the current industry-hating government. We had to start up old coal production to just meet energy needs.
Nah! They New France.
Possibly. BYD doesn’t seem to be getting traction in Canada. Maybe it will in the US?  Although, I’m thinking when a US citizen associates a car with China they may not be huuuuge on the uptake of that vehicle?
Good bot. Thank you for ya service 🫡
ìn which aspect do they have an advantage? Their odel3 is from 2017. Thats 8 years ago.  FSD was a hoax, its still a decade away from beeing useful, whereas Mercedes already has working level 5 stuff. Billions of damaging sues will come in from broken promises and covered up accidents.
I got rich off apple.  TSLA is a ballon with no pilot.  Good luck tho.
pretty sure toyota will have em next year
I don’t know, did he actually found them or did he pay to be named a founder?
*ape
Lots of Texans saw this coming too.
Cutting budgets for education?  Texas also has one of the highest rates of illiteracy in the nation.
Heat, home taxes
It’s been 100+ in San Antonio for about the past 30  days. It’ll be a climate hellscape before Michigan.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)
Texas has high home taxes bc no income tax. F that
Ew why would anyone want to be Florida
"a millwright is engaged with the erection of machinery"
Oh that’s neat
Or for Tesla, giga presses and robots.
Agreed. How do we make money off this situation?
Correct. Megapacks have been successfully operating in Australia and Hawaii for years, with Australia stating millions in savings yearly and the success of them. Tesla just didn’t have the capability to produce at a large amount. They are currently  building out another factory for megapacks, with a 2 year backlog on their site. The inflation reduction act and other gov legislation will increase the demand and crazy levels. They also create the ai software used to run these battery storage solutions. Another win!
About tree fiddy
Tesla fans are so funny
I would assume that by the time Tesla hits $10T Apple will be approaching $25T. I give it about a dozen years or so honestly unless climate catastrophe forces us into a doomsday world.
Yes
I want whatever you guys are smoking…you realize they would have to roughly add $1.5 trillion in marketcap every year to reach $10 trillion by 2030? 10 trillion would be about 30% of the forecasted us gdp in 2030
Yes my time line is about 20 years out. I see I’m getting down voted but it must be by bears that are going to rekt  tomorrow on puts.
I found a bear. A dead bear.
Your comparing Tesla's PE to that of OEM's, implying they are comparable, ignoring everything else they do.  The fact that the OEM's have mostly invested in tech that will be obsolete within a decade is another reason why you comparing PE's is idiotic.  How much debt does Tesla have? How much debt to the others have? Yet you compare PE's.
LOL OK.  What do I know, I just work with people who have worked at tesla?
I don’t get why. Musk seems goofy and wack at times but Tesla is that disruptive, game changer of a business

Suuure. Except that VW is already stopping the development of ICEs, just like subsidiary Audi.  https://www.roadandtrack.com/news/a35901171/volkswagen-will-also-stop-developing-internal-combustion-engines/  You Tesla fanboys need to look up and around a bit more often. The world doesn’t stop, you know?
EV market size by region, 2022:   • US: $1.1bn, 3 million EVs on the road    • Europe: $2.7bn, 9.5 million EVs on the road    • China: $6.2bn, 13.8 million EVs on the road  Adoption in the US is incredibly slow, given the size of the market you skillfully pointed out. Because environmental awareness and the willingness to even slightly inconvenience oneself for a wider benfit … *sucks*.   But go ahead, keep thinking you’re the center of the universe.
Keep telling yourself what you want. The fact is that Tesla had a US market share in EVs of 78% in 2018, 62% in 2022, about 50% today, and BofA projects it will be 18% by 2026.  This doesn't mean Tesla will shrink. The entire segment is growing rapidly. But to assume they will continue to dominate when consumers have an ever-increasing range of choices, is delusional.  [Here's a read](https://www.axios.com/2023/04/05/tesla-ev-electric-vehicle-adoption), if you're interested.
I saw my first Rivian out there. I stood in the parking lot for several minutes just staring because I’d only seen it in pictures before
where? i was in zurich last month and it as more like 1 in 100, if that.
They did - the BZ4X. It was a complete shambles, there was a recall because the wheels would literally fall off. Even if it worked fine, the cost was extortionately ridiculous vs even non-Tesla rivals.  Toyota was first to mass electrification ten years back - but apparently their boomer bean counters didn’t want to keep pushing that edge, instead deciding to enjoy an easy lead with zero new EV investment.   Now they are years behind on EVs and they are struggling to catch-up.
Toyota will never go full EV.
Neither have figured out how to produce a ev profitably yet, then there is dealership mark up to deal with. All while Tesla’s focus on manufacturing will allow for their production cost to continue to drop. Their cars look better than tesla buts it’s inferior in every way and more costly.
This is the best description of supercharging i have read
Tesla Finance will make a mint
Any possibility if happening this by end of the week?
I dunno who that guy but the story is real. Couldnt even resell the cars  [https://www.reuters.com/article/factcheck-cars-china-idUSL1N2OP2AA](https://www.reuters.com/article/factcheck-cars-china-idUSL1N2OP2AA)
Sorry it goes against your puts but no, it’s not.
I just know I’m buying Tesla my next vehicle
Their reliability ratings are so poor that they score the best in brand retention, they are -by far- the brand that people who bought one will buy from the same brand again.  If all the FUD was true, this would not be the case.  A lot of those ratings are arbitrary rules they don't fully disclose and they even admit they don't get the data from Tesla that they receive from other brands, admitting it's made up bs.
  Reliability is relative.   I have a half million miles on my Ford F150 that's 15 years old.  No major problems or issues in that time period.  During that time I've spent about $25,000 in fuel and maybe another $10,000 in preventive maintenance like oil changes and tires.    A model 3 needs a new battery around every 80k miles.  An extended range battery costs $25k.  Let's be real a "standard" battery isn't actually usable in the real world.  If I'm lucky 500k miles in a model 3 would cost me about a little north of $150,000 with inflation.  If you include the original cost of the car and financing, one of those things costs about a quarter million over its life.  Based on my research I could rely on a Tesla being a giant hole I would have to shovel money into.        Also if you let it automagically drive you around, it might kill you.  If you run over something in the road it might catch fire.  Don't be Walter Huang.
No because none of them have self driving I’m impressed by  But even if TSLA won I wouldn’t buy because ELON is a POS
Totally fucked… and Tesla chose Germany to be their EU production site
Stick with that narrative, it will see you thrive!
That is a very fair point.
What they have in illiteracy they make up for with guns. Yosemite Sam will be shooting that car engine into compliance.
The Tesla bears are real quiet today
.00000035
Fans don’t make money and are irrational so I’m not a fan I’m an investor..my timeline is 20 years out. 10 trillion sounds pie in the sky but the Dutch East India company was worth about 8 trillion in market cap inflation adjusted. So getting to 10 trillion for a modern company isn’t some far fetched thesis…have fun getting your ass handed to you today with your Tesla Puts.
You believe that Apple will 8x its current market cap in 12 years? Lol
Tesla will sell 10 (poorly QC'd and fit) Teslas to every person on Earth by 2028 (and report 100 Teslas sold per customer), don't you see?
Don't forget that they are already making a surplus of cars now. Like even with their discounts people in the US aren't buying. China is going to be their largest market even as their population is dropping.
I mean... what the actual fuck does Tesla have that's worth 10 trillion? It's a car brand bruh.
> Your comparing Tesla's PE to that of OEM's, implying they are comparable, ignoring everything else they do.  Can you not fucking read? I used P/E as an example to show that OP's idiotic post ignored any semblance of valuation differences. I am not saying low P/E = cheap, high P/E = expensive. I just use it as a shorthand metric to show that the market is already pricing in OEMs for extinction while pricing tesla for massive growth. I don't think you understand the absurdity of something with a stable (and even growing) net income trading at a P/E of 3.  Also, all companies are comparable, that's literally what valuation metrics are for you nutjob. It just requires a little more work than just looking at a P/E. Doesn't mean the P/E holds no information. The only reason you think nothing can be compared to tesla is because you probably only ever looked at a single company. BTW, only idiots hang out in single stock subreddits like TSLAlounge, they only exist as echochambers to circlejerk in.  > The fact that the OEM's have mostly invested in tech that will be obsolete within a decade is another reason why you comparing PE's is idiotic.  If it's obsolete in a decade, and you're trading at a P/E of 3, how many times can you make your current market cap in cash in 9-10 years? You idiots seem to think "unga bunga OEMs bad, so fair value $0; tesla good so fair value infinity". Even companies in decline can be cheap moron.  > How much debt does Tesla have? How much debt to the others have? Yet you compare PE's.  Congratz, you actually fucking circled back to the original point of my comment. I literally give you the reason why these debts are not comparable as you are co-mingling their financing arms (leases) with actual automotive debt. But hurr durr its the P/E thats not comparable. [Here, page 154, if you can actually read a balance sheet that is.](https://www.volkswagen-group.com/en/financial-reports-volkswagen-group-15928)
Sure, everyone should just believe you, making unsubstantiated claims.  I'm not saying they have to believe me, but I also know people who work at Tesla who worked at other OEM's before and report the exact opposite of what you are saying.  It's possible this was different pre 2021, it isn't the case now.  Did you even take stock based compensation into account? Show me another company (in the automotive industry) that offered that kind of value the last 4 years.
The more time Musk spends fucking up Twitter the better off Tesla is
Careful, I think you hurt someone's feelings.
TSLA up 7% today, but keep on not making money and being bitter about it.      With appe smartphones also grew rapidly, do you know what happened next? Never bet against people with private rocket ship companies. That this needs saying is just funny.
one of my coworkers owns one. i constantly catch myself looking at it.
Lausanne area, i even saw 2 tesla back to back today xD ( NB: it's mostly model 3 which are on the cheaper side, people are buying the super expensive models)
I thought they didn’t get into EV because they bet on hydrogen taking off
Well no wonder japans has been so fucked for years. You can't just forever squeeze your employees.
I know some of those Tesla bois splooged all over their phone screens after reading that.
Up 6% pre market, so who knows. Shorts been getting pretty eager lately, so this bitch can go way over 300
Oh that's Kandi, makes much more sense. China had an EV startup boom with over 100 EV brands and the industry has consolidated down to 20 or so. The other 80 that failed is bound to have unsold cars nobody wants.
I have no puts but I did have a model 3 for a year and auto wipers alone are enough to infuriate any normal human being
I'd like to know where you're getting fuel that cheap, my back of envelope calcs say about $160k aud in fuel so about $110k USD so unless your fuel is 1/4 of the price compared to here I call bullshit, same as your maintenance costs.
Lol do the math man how is it possible to drive 500,000 miles and pay 25000 in fuel unless you're paying $1 a gallon. I call bs
What? A model 3 can drive over 300K miles on a battery, this has been proven in reality many times. There are exceptions, there's also people who drive an F150 that needed a new engine below 15K miles, exceptions don't tell the whole story.  ICE cars catch on fire at a MUCH higher rate, including when standing still and when nobody is around or when at the PUMP.
lol this is so wrong not even going to bother
Made sense at the time for the skilled labor in car manufacturing and good logistics network + germany is boss of EU so creating some goodwill with the corrupt politicians not only in Germany but more importantly in the unelected EU beurocracy that is the real economy power     But the grid is totally fucked

Energy and software…the entire world is transitioning to clean energy and that will take tens of trillions of dollars if not hundreds of trillions of dollars over the next 20 years. The United States government has already recognized Tesla’s megapacks as a critical part of that transition. Energy alone could easily be worth 5 trillion…FSD will revolutionize the travel experience and margins on software could easily hit 90 percent. Another 2 trillion…and Tesla will produce and deliver 20 million cars a year in the next 20 years. Another 3 trillion.
Our operators make $31 per hour top out (plus 10% shift diff) under their current contract.  It's going to be raised under current negotiations this year.  They pay $50 to go to the doctor whether they have a cold or open heart surgery.  Pretty cushy.  From what i gather online that's about what operators make at tesla in high cost of living areas.    I only know salary people who have worked at tesla.
Never bet against people who buy a business for $44bn and lose 75% of that valuation in less than a year. Check.
Nah their investment into hydrogen was tokenisitc at best. Their one model in the Mirai has been a party piece with very little else. Now compare what Tesla had to do to make EVs scalable, with investments into supercharging and large scale battery technology etc.   Toyota just made a half hearted attempt and left it there
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271) wipers, really!? I’m talking reliability. Reliability is unmatched in my personal experience and I’ve owned most big auto brands.
So, no response to stock based compensation?  From what you gather online? So your information about Tesla wages is because you know so many people who worked at Tesla and are doing a similar job somewhere else now...
And that was his private money so he can shit post whatever he wants. Has nothing to do with developing a tech company. Burnt some money on that one, you win some you lose some. Doesn't change anything about how future-proof TSLA is.
Like every other car brand with new tech. Boring and just propaganda for subsidies but nothing to show for it.
Tesla buys batteries from BYD: they got by purely on hype, cooked books and gov't subsidies
Well, not exactly. He borrowed $20bn from banks and $7bn from private individuals. Of the $20bn, $7bn had to be secured by $62bn in Tesla stock. So if Twitter defaults on the debt, Musk is going to have to unload Tesla shares.   But that’s an aside. The point is, he’s clearly overextended himself. At what other listed company would people be happy with a part-time CEO?  I feel like your username sometimes …

China is not bouncing back. The CCP is thinking of MORE stimulus ideas while the rest of the world is raising interest rates trying to cool things down.  The thing about voluntary oil quotas, they are voluntary. Desperate countries that need oil revenue have an incentive to cheat.
Electric vehicle deliveries = oil demand decline.  Smart money is shorting. $TSLA vs $XOM who you shorting?
We are about to set a 2% oil demand increase from prior year and break the global record set in 2019.  Next year is projected to break this years growth. In fact, output is supposed to increase annually through 2030 on the most conservative assumptions.  Where are you seeing declines?

Why TROW?
I have held these options since May and  everyday I've checked I haven't seen anything come out past what I saw in the beginning, January 2025.
Thanks,  They have an incredible balance sheet they are sitting on; just look at that: [https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1113169/000111316923000014/trow-20230331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1113169/000111316923000014/trow-20230331.htm)  I think TROW is worth well over $107-ish/share and the market has thought so too If you look at a chart. Since only last June there have been 3 times when the market registered a price of about $125/share or more, and I believe there are numerous catalysts to set it off again. If not to 125 then around 117.5 no problem, plus most of the options have 570 days from today's date left in time value.

Market corrects by middle of the month. And starts creeping back up by august is my take
Yes, but first ATH I think. Correction probably starting late august and through 2024….
500 by end of year is the conservative estimate
Wait so 453 in 2 weeks them a 30 point run in 4 weeks after?

August into September has usually been one of the worst periods for performance in the stock market. Not very likely to happen

And 2022 isn’t 2023. 2018 isn’t 2023. You’re trying to create a pattern where none exists and using random factors to explain it with no evidence to show they’re connected. Aka guessing.

Correction -Hey.
It's simple.  You pull a chair up to the game table and open your wallet.  We take money out of your wallet.  When you've had enough, you close your wallet and go home.  This is the big boy table.  This is real money.  You came here to take the money out of my wallet.  I take no responsibility if you are bad at the game and forget to close your wallet.
Wait, you guys aren't really gambling away all your money...... right?
I'd like an updatem i hope he's okay.
Likely a lot of posts are fake and bots, but once in a while we get a glorious ape who goes full regard. The ol saying, some people have more money than brains, is a fact.
I’ll see you behind Wendy’s, I hear bots are super talented 🤌
I don't I try to shut down the madness before I see sadness.
This is great bruh  If you only had this kind of passion and hard work towards researching before your trades.....
Did he just eat that stripper?
Why don't you just edit the sprites in the game?  Then you can play the whole thing that way.  https://www.reddit.com/r/nes/comments/zno8ai/i_created_a_web_app_for_editing_super_mario_bros/
You run into ThetaMan in level 6 and you start to feel the effects by level 9
Make sure Jerome Powell is the final boss.
Yea def seems like it would be easier for you to just mod the actual game
This is equivalent to having one of the hottest stripper you've ever seen in a good while grinding you for 16 seconds, and then just walked away without saying a thing
Need king Koopa powell
He eats strippers? I just pound em.

damn that old conspiracy ages well
People really will believe anything
thank you VisualMod, you've summarized well
Highly unlikely, don’t ask how I know. I have placed puts since share moved up to $50, the momentum is strong. Catalyst can made them go down quick and deep: earning, or recession. Any slight disappointment in their next earning, especially if they can’t turn positive EBITDA, they are fucked. It’s highly probable they will have a bad earning based on my findings
Did you mean Waystar?
I would believe I agree with you.

Oil, you always find a way to keep us entertained! Bravo!
i’ve been looking at PBR calls as well.
Congratulations! I also have found success in oil. Are you buying anything going into Opec international conference next week?
No way PBR goes to 16. I've been invested in them for a bit myself. But I don't think they'll hit 16.
Man, you turned that oil rollercoaster into an oil masterpiece! Bravo! 😂👏
Oil, you've truly taken us on a wild ride! 🛢️💥
TLDR. I saw PBR and I'm all in.
they're gonna eventually ban me from talkin about it here too but, RAD is about to be the biggest pharmacy in the world next 5-10 years. they just partnered with amazon last month and their amazon page looks like hefe bezos believes in them. so I do too and at that price I bought 2500 shares @ $1.50, I'm gonna keep buying and holding because I'm pretty sure this ones gonna be an infinite $ glitch lol
Nice never really lost a lot but learned and got better like you did still learning nice comeback
This is why I’m still in oil. PBT has made me over 40k and still have plenty of room to grow. Monthly payouts are nice as  well
short then long, I take it?
If it makes you feel better I lost 4k yesterday too. No? It doesn't? I tired.
My DVN stock was to the moon for a while there. It’s come back down some but I’m going to hold it long term.
Wait so is that it? Are you done?
this is not the end for oi  tis but a scratch and we shall return victorious   and I will finally make money
About to double top
 Hear me now, children, for my occupation is of much import. For 82 years I have been an oil man, a ‘barren’ some have called me. Now what does an oil barren do? The answer…crush your enemies! Grind their bones into dirt! Make them regret that they were ever born!
Story is not over yet
premarkets lookin good 🙌
Fubo still undervalued at 600 million market cap. 1.7 sales...multiple like hulu, disney, sling= 6.50 a share. Needs to run to at least 4. It's a gem
Did you dump your tears from out that bucket? 🤣
This is just play money right, please tell me your sons future isn't tied to shib or pltr?
I feel like you held Luna and never sold if you are holding Shib🤣
I disagree. As we evolve in society, the general consensus is that we need to ween ourselves off of fossil fuels and shift towards renewable energy. Not only that, the free world is looking to bankrupt pur Russian enemies' main source of income. More than 30% of russians GTP is the sale of fossil fuels. If the big democracies of the world and their major consumers shift towards renewable, our Russian enemies get weaker...
Idk if anyone will see this please help me out school and work is hard anything will help $devking89

Looks like mine from last week  https://preview.redd.it/1rovpvtiir9b1.jpeg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5fb95269a0df446d078e0cc640f5c0ba35e9ddad
I bought the shares and sold covered calls and poached the ex dividend dates and used the calls as an exit strategy to reduce my position from 825 shares to 425, did this to lock in my gains.    Another ex dividend date is coming up in august sometime, I’m sure.  I’m trying to reduce my position to 125-250 shares before then.   Then snatch up a bunch before the dividend. Capture the dividend and it should rebound shortly after and sell calls to reduce my position again… 🤷🏻 don’t know if it’s a sound strategy but I hope it works
I'm a fan of that stock, def calls
Honestly no… I’m anticipating that OPEC will push an agenda aimed at propping up oil prices but for what I’m doing with Pbr it doesn’t much matter… unless there is a large disruption in the market… an oil “crash” so to speak….  I will hold Pbr and sell calls, adding and subtracting from my position as to capture the dividend and lock in gains occasionally, all the while sell calls with a strike price above underlying price and also if it were to rise, at a level that is acceptable to me, if the calls were to be exercised.   I don’t think OPECs meeting will have a lasting effect until practical matters are affected.  I’m sure there will be a price reaction. But it will be short lived if the fundamentals don’t change or shift in a direction contrary to their agenda.  From what I understand they want to cut supply as to lift the price of oil. Saudi Arabia prefers oil to sell near $80/barrel I believe….  As much power as they have, it’s hard to have complete control over such a vast industry. 🤷🏻
Still buying Shell
Yeah I’m not sure Pbr will go to 16 but all the better because that means I can sell calls with 16 strike price and they will expire worthless and I can pocket the premium… or buy it back at a lower price for a net gain before expiration. worse case scenario the price of Pbr goes above 16 and I am forced to sell 100 shares at $16,  which would lock in gains for me…
What makes you think this?  And why would you get banned?
https://preview.redd.it/a7sua1e4pl9b1.jpeg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=18c76d2bfee38b7f7acd78496d4b9f9b4de734e7  I entered these positions because I thought there was a lot of upside and I wanted to sell covered calls on the way up, and collect dividends as well. I bought the corporate bond etfs because it’s a nest egg for my son.  I bought crypto to have some exposure.
Yeah PBT looks like it was a solid move!!! Over the past year up 50%!!!! Plus it’s pays a pretty solid dividend… It’s not supported on Robinhood unfortunately… I’d be looking to add that to my Roth IRA perhaps
I’m not sure what you mean by short then long?  But previously back in 2019 and early 2020 I was using UWT and DWT.  They were leveraged 3x  UWT went up when oil did and DWT went down when oil did times 3.  Summed up.  Well you can guess which one I was in when the pandemic crash hit…. I just wasn’t very disciplined at the time and highly inexperienced… if I would have had the knowledge (not much but a little more) and patience I have now… I probably would have been in DWT and would be a millionaire… Long story short UWT and DWT were discontinued (UWT after massive losses and DWT after unprecedented gains- they were tied to each other, some fancy financial instruments etc etc etc) let’s just say I didn’t understand it well then and I still have a loose grasp of it but know enough that it was WAY to risky for a newb to be messing with it…
Get some sleep!
🤦🏻‍♂️
Yeah that seems like a pretty good one…
🤣🤣 Yep, I’m retiring and riding off into the sunset… living off of 9 grand!!! Wish me luck.   🤣🤣
I don’t have much in shib or PLTR.     His is in corporate bond etfs.   Most of this is my savings/play money.
Never had Luna…. But I’ve had a rough go with crypto.  Those basically are my lottery tickets.  I’m up with bitcoin, eth and bitcoin cash.  Down slightly with shib.   I’ve been hacked/scammed out of few thousand messing with coinbase and back and forth transfers.
Disagree? With what? My gains… you can’t “disagree” with numbers… I experienced  59% returns since I started investing, predominantly from investing in oil summed up. Facts. Isn’t up for debate.. Do you disagree with my ethics?  That i ethically shouldn’t invest in anything related to fossil fuels?  Based on what?  A theory that we can destroy Russia by transitioning away from fossil fuels and it would be ultimately better if mankind as a whole didn’t rely on fossil fuel?  Well in the meantime, in a place I like to call reality, I am capitalizing on an opportunity… Don’t worry I’m not completely oblivious to times are a changing…. I have solar panels on my roof as we speak…. I’m diversified 😉
Trust me. Wish I had more than chump change 😅
Maybe he lives in Rome?
All roads lead back home though..?
The only acceptable road is Wendy’s. Everything else is a damn lie
Gotta do a U-turn first
Wait what..
Interesting take. I also believe any short term jump in price will be short lived. And that’s a great idea to trade covered calls to generate income. I do the same thing with Energy Transfer and Enterprise Product partners stock options… premiums for otm options are just so low rn the return on capital is low.. generally since  oil has fallen so much I’m bullish on a eventual recovery longer term 2024 as China oil demand picks up. I’ve found I can get greater returns on capital by holding shares of UCO( 2x leveraged WTI) and selling covered calls against that investment while oil remains rangebound. I use optionsprofitcalcultor, and always looking for those good risk to reward opportunities with high probability of profit.. that make you money over time.. which can fund riskier trades… like this weeks opec July 7th USO weekly 3 DTE call spreads I’m opening when the market opens this Wednesday. A gamble on Opec reaffirming oil production cuts
True, if they go above 16 I don't see it lasting for an extended period of time. Unfortunately PBR.A has been my most successful Investment so far, but one of my smallest. Wish I bought more when I first made the position years ago. I've covered my cost basis in dividends alone so if I sell my cost basis is $0.00. Pure profit.
because they're worth 1.50 at 85.21M market cap. So severely under priced, even if they were close to bankruptcy. which theyve had no talks of such. And I already got banned out of every other stock subreddit and discord for talkin about it. So its' obviously a conspiracy.
if we all bout the remaining 55M shares avail of RAD and held em hostage, I bet theyd value it for half of what its worth just to get us to sell.
Its had 60% or more options volume for as loong as u can look back, some days @ 90%. It's also the only stock that doesnt follow a covid curve. 3.20.20 they're up that day. It actually follows a meme stock curve if you look at the spikes closely. They've been pushing this stock down so bad that they want us all to hate it and forget about it when its time to go off
He means 10k, not 10 y/o
I have bills, a kid, a mortgage.  A rental property….  I’m broke all the time 😅
Now that’s an idea… advanced for sure… I’ll have to take a look at that leveraged WTI.   I got burnt in 2020 on one… but I could try it out on a small scale
I’m a little curious exactly what you do with UCO?  Doesn’t it decay , inherently?  And what are the risks associated with it?
It’s weird that I don’t have an analyst ratings or research report… i usually get that with my Robinhood gold.  So what does all that mean?   What’s your total position and average buy in?   Is it a meme stock?  Or it way past that?  You’re telling my that rite aid is only valued at roughly 87 million dollars?  Where does the conspiracy come into it?  For whom would that benefit?
That’s a lot of pressure for a 10 year old
Can’t be that broke with 5k to spare, I’m actually broke with two kids and an apartment with 4k in TDA with biweekly 30 dollar deposits, I should’ve sold that Doge when it hit 74 cents..
I don’t get why some people think buying risky ass oil ETF’s is somehow a better strategy than splitting that same money into Exxon, Chevron, and Oxy.
If it has a market cap of 85M, think of what the earnings could be when in 5-10 years its market cap reflects what amazons today, which is $130 per @ 1.34T market cap. We can assume AMZN will only continue to grow as they're the largest retailer in the world. So if RAD continues in a trajectory similar to amazon, also being a pharmacy, there's no telling what it would be worth. And the reason I've been so criticized for talking about it, and for all institutions and websites saying to avoid it, should just show that its a conspiracy.     and if we go to believe its a conspiracy, then we kno the people behind the curtain love numbers. Numbers and their meaning. I personally hate the stuff, but "they" believe numerology is real. And It must be because it is tied into our language even. Plus its pretty obvious they control us with numbers.     the market cap changed in the past couple days also, it went from 86.9M to 85.21M. Just look at the difference between what numberology says about the two numbers,   86- The number 86 vibration loves organizing social events and mobilizing large groups of people. It gives an ability to be service-minded, loving, and to have strong self-control. It has an excellent aesthetic sense and goes into detail, as well as being able to see the overall picture. ([https://www.numerologistpro.com/numerology-numbers/numerology-number-86-meaning/](https://www.numerologistpro.com/numerology-numbers/numerology-number-86-meaning/))  9-9 is the strongest and most masculine of all the numbers and gives inner strength, power, and the ability to focus one's energies. 9 resonates with the planet Mars also known as Ares. Mars was the Roman God of war and was strong physically and mentally. 9 is the number of the warrior and gives a strong will, determination, and independence in dealing with all aspects of life, always going for the essence of things. But it can also be full of heart and very sensitive, which is reflected in Ares's dual nature as both a strong warrior and a sensitive dancer. ([https://www.numerologistpro.com/numerology-numbers/numerology-number-9-meaning/](https://www.numerologistpro.com/numerology-numbers/numerology-number-9-meaning/))  v.s  85- The number 85/4 vibration is called a "world conqueror," just like the number 58/4, and like 58/4, 85/4 wishes to conquer the world with its new and genius ideas. 85 is more controlled and thinks more about the consequences of its actions. This number gives an interest in politics, business, and expansion, both materially and in terms of influence. Because the 85 has a digit sum 13/4, it does things in its own unique way. But at the same time, we have the number 8, which is very "traditional" and likes to do things in the same way as they have been done for generations. This exciting blend between traditional and new gives the number 85/4 the ability to succeed through a very original career. It could, for example, introduce something revolutionary into a very traditional career path or create something revolutionary, but in a traditional way. ([https://www.numerologistpro.com/numerology-numbers/numerology-number-85-meaning/](https://www.numerologistpro.com/numerology-numbers/numerology-number-85-meaning/))  21-21 gives knowledge, diligence, and the ability to achieve great success after putting in a significant amount of effort. The number 21 is a magical number that symbolizes the entire universe and that you can crack the code of success. With 21/3, you have innate intelligence and the ability to get results with all that you do. ([https://www.numerologistpro.com/numerology-numbers/numerology-number-21-meaning/](https://www.numerologistpro.com/numerology-numbers/numerology-number-21-meaning/))  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  I, like I said hate numerology. Plus people say I'm trynna get rid of my shares by shilling. which I'm not. I have 2500 @ 1.52, so If I wanna back out at their Lowest of lowes, I can break even I'm fine. I truly believe this is the ultimate buy and hold they dont want us in on. They've been planning it since at least before covid and I dont believe they are far from pulling it. as you can see, their current market caps numerology meaning ("their" favorite language) It basically says after significant due diligence, along with planning and effort, its time to take over the world lol.   I dont even feel like I'm that correct about this is more of a shot in the dark. However, I feel like IF the conspiracy of the world being ran by the bankers and the federal reserve, and pvt military industrial complex is real. Then this is the stock for longevity and infinite gains. Planned and plotted by those same elite, long ago. So long ago that's why they made it the original "MEME STOCK"   they wanted retail investors to be so cuckolded, and hold so much animosity for this stock, that when it became time for them to start scaling it up, retail is going to look at it as the boy who cried wolf and they arent going to jup in on it until its too late. You can call me crazy. And If I lose my 4k investment. I'll just watch it all the way to the bottom because thats how much I feel it may be real.  &#x200B;  And they always say no risk no reward. This is the highest risk, with the possible highest reward.
I have a job.  Im a union laborer. I mason tend. I work with bricklayers. Hard work but I make decent money but i got bills.
I’m kinda curious as well.   I initially got burnt on UWT and DWT.  You can see by photos complimenting this post… I’m just curious to how this leveraged etf would be better than what I’m doing with PBR.  🤷🏻
Ok.  So how is it going to go up?  Will Amazon acquire it?  As it stands now.  Facts alone, ignoring the “conspiracy” stuff. Rite aid is financially in trouble. They have good revenue, but saddled with debt. The CEO stepped down this year and Amazon prime partnered with them in march I believe. I’m trying to remain objective but it’s hard to see much upside to rite aid, although a glimmer of hope does exist
vis here playing both sides so he always comes out on top
Why would it matter? It’s like a Netflix subscription. If I’m not watching in San Francisco, why would that matter in earnings if I am paying a subscription in NY?
It depends what it means by "cellphone activity." Is it bandwidth usage or the number of calls/texts sent?
They’re invested in what is now unneeded capacity in some dense urban areas. The capacity is now unneeded due to out-migration as well as WFH trend.  Now they will need to invest in greater capacity in smaller, growing towns in different areas.  So, sure it’ll have some impact on capital expense.  But a lot of this infrastructure gets periodically replaced due to newer bands and standards. So in many places, they can just retire some of the old equipment without replacement and spend the money elsewhere.  Telcos are very tuned-in and have capacity planners who research the real-estate markets.
People don't answer their phone because of all the spam calls.
Another statistic that means absolutely nothing
Because if you're the 1 person in  Nebraska with a Netflix subscription, it's not going to hold up the company against the 1,000,000 people in California suddenly dropping it
Do you need an unlimited plan if you are at home most of the time? People could adjust plans down which could force price reduction by carriers.
Im guessing its raw data usage, probably due to people not being in the city or work from home allowing people to use home wifi connections.
Bigger pipes to the burbs is expensive to dig I don't think they have a bunch of dark fiber ready to plugin
Phone numbers I hope are dying thing.   I know they aren’t probably because bill collectors and cell phone companies can force bundling.
You do know that people have been leaving California right?
What you’re seeing is people leaving San Francisco because it’s a shit place to live. You should really pay attention to real life factors before anchoring your beliefs in numbers so die-hard.
I dunno. My rural ass mountain town has fiber optics.
Yes, I'm painfully aware because they've destroyed my hometown in the span of about 3 years from moving here.  The point is that the location doesn't matter. The amount of people using the service does. Which you have now realized for yourself hopefully, after reflecting on your initial comment
That’s a substantial amount of shitholes if its just that, not saying SF isn’t one.
You do know you should read statistics more critically because location matters.  “Major Cities” is not representative of America, nor is it even representative of its local metropolitan clusters.
Because major cities is a shit place to raise a family and grow wealth.   Who the hell making 150-250k a year wants to pay rent in the 4-6k’s, HOA in the 100s, buy a small property of <1000 sqft for 2m. When you can move to the smaller less known city 30 miles away, pay 700k-1m for a two story single family home with 2k sqft?
>Why would it matter? It’s like a Netflix subscription. If I’m not watching in San Francisco, why would that matter in earnings if I am paying a subscription in NY?  This is your original comment.  Read it. Then read the comment you just made.
Yeah, I'm not sure this is actually telling us much about cell phones. I guarantee you that people's overall cell phone usage has not dropped significantly. Instead, it's telling us that these cities are getting way less traffic. Also, this graph compares a single week, which seems way too small a sample.
Please follow the conversation and read context.  OP’s hypothesis is this chart may be indicative of bad earnings due to lower cell phone use in “MAJOR CITIES”.  My point is if you know there has been demographic flight from “MAJOR CITIES”, then your metric you are using is not indicative of lower sales or at best extremely faulty at what you are measuring.
To be clear I asked if it would be good or bad, it could increase infrastructure cost in rural areas where bandwidth is more expensive or could let the carriers free ride by doing nothing and keeping the subs.
I feel like we're saying the same thing here
It’s irrelevant. You can move 50 miles away from any of the cities listed in that graph, still be in a city with infrastructure and not be counted in that graph.  Imagine being in LA, but you move over to Burbank, all of a sudden you are not counted.
Well if the Burbank cell tower has the capacity for 5000 concurrent connections and now 10k are using it that costs money to fix
With how shit cell service is in general. I don’t think they care. It’d have to be a demand for 20k for them to even lift a finger.
Unironically, if they noticed that uptick, I imagine they’ll go to Burbank’s mayor and ask for some subsidy to increase capacity 🤣.
You're right, and it seems you know the answer to your question. Assume revenue will remain steady--people leaving major cities end up SOMEWHERE, but they may need to build more towers in boom towns wherever they end up. It's still not likely to make the stocks decline in a significant way, but maybe.
The stock is becoming similar to Tesla in some ways.  At these prices, I wouldn’t own it but I wouldn’t short it.
Didn’t hear AVGO CEO say AI once. NEXT!
Imagine thinking fundamentals matter ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Their R&D is intangible, and the speculation is wild. Does that mean it's overvalued?... maybe?
Everything is overvalued right now lol
So long  Nivida puts is what I’m hearing
Current income is only part of the value.  Potential future income plays a big role.  Hell, past income plays a role.  You've gotta visit all of the ghosts, not just Christmas present
NVIDIA has cult following …. When you have such group of people pushing prices of stocks higher , the only thing that matters to them is NVIDIA stock prices going higher
Don’t fight the trend of what people are doing. but yeah, if you look at classic financial ratios and indicators it is overbought and at too high of a price.   The company sells graphics cards so your Skyrim nudes look better…not exactly curing cancer.
does avgo ceo wear a leather jacket and look sexy as hell?
Does AVGO make the A100 or an equivalent?   No? Then it’s a false equivalency to NVDA.
500 by Aug
Lmao NVDA bears are loving the hopium
Yes but AI. Until you can make an argument of who can outperform NVIDIA for AI… I mean I don’t know what to tell you. Currently it gives them a massive moat. It’s sad but the way things are… they might be the main source for the near future.   It’s like cars went from the t-model to 1990+ roads over night. Suddenly everyone has to change their tires, their shocks, etc to drive on the freeway and paved roads, and there is only like 1-2 companies that have that infrastructure, well then all car manufacturers would turn to them right? Until competition catches up. Well it hasn’t so here we are and hence the massive pump.   Until an alternative can be found… no one wants to be the one missing out.
A key takeaway, market cap is an imaginary number. Every single week Wall Street pulls a fortune out of the paychecks of almost every working person in America to plow into the market through every fund imaginable.   If any of the ratios become unfavorable it is just because there is so much money coming in that they have to put it somewhere. The only time it is really useful is when something is too low, like Micron a few years ago when it had a PE ratio of like 3, or when Meta dipped to like 7 last fall. If it is too high it just means all the managers in the world think it is a safe bet.

NVDA does have hands down the best products in the sector - AI and Crypto need their products in large quantities.  They have a strong future - but I'm with you, I think they're oversold /  overvalued.
THIS GUY IS A SHORT SELLER.
AMD is the closest comp, but their chips are only about 75% the quality.  So there's not a ton of competition in the near term for that company.
Yes everyone knows nvidia is at least $200 overvalued but no one could tell you when it will go down. It’s too profitable to keep it popped up with options volatility to let it go down.
Fuck off on this bullshit analysis. Fundamentals don’t matter - it’s literally all a gambling on the future play. Always has been and always will be. If / when NVDAs future looks less bright there will be hell to pay, until then fuck off.
The AI hype has to fade away in some point. When that happens, it will come down. Insiders ditched millions in stocks already why ? They know it is overvalued.  What will trigger this correction ? This is the question
Yeah, they are both overvalued.
Yes
Nvidia has pissed off a lot of people this year..  RIP EVGA
Anybody buying right now because “AI” is 100% regarded and doesn’t understand the first thing about it. NVDA is extremely overvalued and will eventually crash massively.
The amazing run-up on nvda is bc of their AI potential in future revenues.  Broadcom isn’t even in the same building, let alone on the same level as nvda is on that front.    Broadcom is trading at fair value for what they currently provide to their consumers, they don’t deserve anymore than that at current stage imo.
Nvidia has a significant head start on accelerated computing, which will power AI, advanced simulation/modeling, data analytics, autonomous driving, data centers, cloud computing, robotics, and other stuff that I’m too regarded to understand.  They are like Apple in that they have their own developer language, CUDA.  I wouldn’t be shocked if NVDA hits a valuation of 10T in the next 5-10years.   They haven’t even begun to monetize their most high margin service lines.  Right now, it’s all gaming, which is solely to keep the lights on and pay for R&D.   Not financial advice.
NVIDIA is so far ahead of the competition it is considered a monopoly
Avgo has many competitors. NVDA H100 is almost monopoly.
I'm just waiting for NVDA to tap $480.54 and then slapping some $200P LEAPs. It's going to be absolutely delicious.      No interest in playing the long for anything more than a week or two when the opportunity presents itself. Chips are cyclical, and AI isn't about to change that.
I hold avgo, I'm 26% up
So Broadcom designs chips used in networking, and not manufactured by them.   NVIDIA designs and builds general purpose computer hardware, and is the number 1 player in AI.
Is a meme stock in 2023. That's enough information to make a decision.
Someday I will have the balls to short NVDA for a measly 1 PUT at a whopping $3.5k.  And I pray to god that it goes down to $280 per share where it belongs before my exp.
Have you been living under a rock? Of course it is
Yes, Nvidia is overvalued and it is a bubble.
NVDA is more overvalued (and price action aswell) than Cisco during the dot com  to put everything in perspective...
“Is NVDA overvalued?”   Yes.
AVGO doesn't make AI chips so comparing them two is pointless
Yes lol anyone saying different and that Nvidia will be making trillions in revenue ten years from now should be laughed at and shamed for being dumb.
Broadcom is still seen as old tech like intel
Just spamming this everywhere eh?
Sir this is a casino
Stop asking this godamn question that’s all anyone talks about 20x everyday “should I buy NVDA should I sell NVDA” NVDA NVDA doesn’t anyone fucking GAMBLE anymore??
This post reads like it's AI generated.
I have no idea if it's overly swollen or not. Giggity.   What I *do* know is I'm about to shave profits out of NVDA shares for the ~6th time over the 5+ years that I've owned it continuously. Not huge amounts, but I usually scrape $3-5k out of it when I've done it in the past. I may not ever sell all my shares, but due to always holding *some*, I've been able to "play with house money" off NVDA for 5+ years and buy other stocks while keeping NVDA shares.   I've been an NVDA investor for closer to 8 years, but there was a 3-4 month window where I sold all my NVDA shares about 6ish years ago after they went from $25-$125. Bought back in around $220 before the 4-1 split...so, the cost equivalent of ~$55 for today's share price and have held most of those ever since.  I made 5x off the first time I bought it and I sold it all. Bought back in, and it has now gone up ~8x from that. It's been a fucking winner...I just wish I had bought more initially lol.  Edit: grammar
Yes. But it doesn't matter.
Nah, wait for the next crypto bull run. Data center & gaming will be bonkers. We’ll see $2T within a few years.
Both AMD and NVDA, yes. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)
Did Broadcom double their sales in 1 Quarter?  Are they mentioned non stop by every media source?  Do they dominate market share in AI chips?
[removed]
What is the future of our society about that is yet to become? That’s what stocks are about.
There is something known as a monopoly. That’s what Nvidia has.
lolol, you think the net income has anything to do with nvdias current valuation, LOL
Boolishh
You can’t convince me this DD wasn’t written by ChatGPT.
First of all “markets can be irrational for long than you can be solvent” secondly, as jeremy grantham of GMO said “ yes i know it is bubble but who knows when it is going to burst it can stay up for years” as we have seen in historical examples.A stock can remain overvalued for a long long time as we can see from the example of tesla.So, i think its going to stay in order to see green numbers on your screen just follow the market momentum
No, it isn't. The technology they've been working on is quite versatile and important. They're also going to open up new revenue streams soon.  AMD is undervalued. They're the Pepsi to nvidia's Coke. They're about 2-3 years behind on software but the hardware is solid.
Yes. Buzzwords aside they have a relative monopoly on the high end accelerator side of HPC and bleeding edge type systems so at least it makes a little sense.
Past performance does not indicate future results.
Man I don’t know. But I keep selling puts and it keeps making me money.
Thanks so much for this info, ChatGPT
I think the valuation by the market is real given current interest rate is  As the bitch in Soros fund says, you can control huge amount computing power with human language,   There must be some valuable due to happen

NVDA puts are so expensive though..
No, there hasn't been a productivity tool like ChatGPT in the past, and NVDA is a critical component of future LLM. All software devs are using LLM for coding right now. This is something on the scale of the industrial and digital revolution.
Chatgpt much? This is pure trash
NVIDIA is not trade on value. It is base on FOMO
Did you factor in the guidance NVDA gave at their last earnings?
Well AI wrote this post so BUY
[deleted]
If NVDA falls so too the stock market
NVDA half the price of AVGO too, consider that
It’s all about speculation, the way it’s looking is that Nvidia will be the main supplier of the world changing AI that is to come.
$SMH and chill. No sense trying to make sense of wild semi price swings otherwise.
I don't care what the business is and what their earnings/revenue guidance was. They are trading at, what, 40x revenue?
Buy 100,shares and sell calls to lower your dca . Lil to loose if you hold long term
I don’t bet against or for companies. I just start selling positions at a high exit I’m comfortable with parting. Works out well for the most part.
Why the heck have I never heard of AVGO and yet remember more about TSMC, UMC, and Samsung's microprocessor foundries for the past 5 years?  Are they even real?
A kind reminder that Carvana has 6.5 Billion in debt![img](emote|t5_2th52|8882)
Jeeezz can you summarize this in a tweet please.
This pricing has nothing to do with net income. It's all about sentiment, positioning, hype, etc.
might be some time before it reaches rational levels. The next earnings call may disappoint and cause a sell off.
I’m all in on 7/21 $400 strike puts. Reassured we are mooning to $500 now.
Why did this come AFTER I bought a $3500 call for NVIDIA :(
NVIDIA might be overvalued, but let's hope their graphics cards are still worth it in gaming!
62% more net income? Well, looks like AVGO needs to start flexing harder to catch up with NVDA's market cap!
AVGO be like: 'I'll take that low market cap and raise you a higher net income!'
Should rename to AIVGO
Who knows when a bubble might pop?  Just know it is an AI-driven bubble stock
Curious, the one thing that the OP mentioned (very thorough btw, thank you) was the net earnings. I’m curious as to how much $ NVIDIA had to invest into their newest technology (in terms of production hardware), and what that effect had on their net earnings?
Good time to be selling Nvidia imo, but I wouldn’t be looking for an alternative, maybe wait 3 months for a major pullback in Nvidia, the CEO is smart at keeping the market excited so their will be more juice 🥤
Basically similar to tesla during its hype of EV's but now its AI
A lot of stocks are overvalued my brother. The stock market is a wild horse XD.
Adbe you can do it
I see a pull back coming as well. 2 more fed hikes, china’s ban, and pushing for a slow down in the economy are my thoughts
AI is the latest buzzword. VCs are throwing money on AI even without a business plan.
“If you have to ask, big man, you can’t afford it”

When a stock becomes a cult. Never short. Just wait for the dip and buy. Yes tsla did crash this year but look what elon had to do for it to happen. Man mash the self destruct button more times than I do when my character is dizzy in street fighter
I own it and I’m shorting it
Yeah. I was wondering if I should buy it because I actually like the company but I did t have cash available but at these prices? No way.
I agree with you on that. What i’m thinking is anyone who thinks they can emulate a Tesla-like rise this year has to consider the following.   Tesla’s rise occurred in a time of Quantitative Easing and record monetary supply, along with 0% interest rates. We are now in the opposite of that. Credit conditions are tightening, Quantitative Tightening and monetary conditions are tightening. Not to mention the ongoing inflation and slowing economy. I find it hard to believe it can happen again under these conditions.
Tesla business in auto industry and energy is very different than Nvidia. Tesla giga factories set it apart from most automakers relying on suppliers for everything.
What if he renamed the company to AVGO… AI? Eh???
3 things Broadcom CEO Hock Tan said about AI on its earnings call  https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2023/06/02/3-things-broadcom-ceo-hock-tan-said-about-ai.html  Broadcom CEO Hock Tan Bullish On AI, Hopeful On VMware Deal  https://www.crn.com/news/channel-programs/broadcom-ceo-hock-tan-bullish-on-ai-hopeful-on-vmware-deal  Broadcom predicts sales from AI will double, offsetting broader slowdown in tech spending  https://amp.scmp.com/tech/tech-trends/article/3222688/broadcom-predicts-sales-ai-will-double-offsetting-broader-slowdown-tech-spending

![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
You'd be left in the dust diddling yourself with a stick.
Only two ways out, valuations become justified through earnings or a nice big dip into the fun zone 😎
Maybe the only thing that's really overvalued is the USD, but since our ruler is measuring each centimeter as an inch, we all think we're packing 9 inchers.
Your face is overvalued right now
can't buy shit because can't tell if it's peak or not. Going to feel FOMO either way.
Small and mid caps there’s some undervalued.
Strongly Agree!
What is long is what I’m thinking 🤔 my nov puts are all in crappers.
Buying 20 puts now
I did go over the wildly inconsistent sales revenue on the part of Nvidia’s past earnings.
Sounds like Tesla mania.
But NVDA is an extreme case. APPL has this cult too but still the CE ratio of APPL is not half as broke as NVDAs
I don't feel that way. I fact, Nvidia right now looks like Microsoft in the 90s. The enthusiasts don't like their dominant and closed environment. Gamers are pissed with the last GPU releases.
Investing in cults is never a good idea. You can make a ton of money tho.
Nvidia doesnt have a cult following unless youd like to call institutional investors cult following.
Yeah. BBBY showed them the way. 🤣🤣🤣
Nvidia cult is only getting stronger it seems.
Never short a cult.
That’s an uniformed take imo. Have you heard of gpt, AI etc? Do you realize h100 gpus cost 40k a pop and cloud providers are tripping over each other to throw money at Nvidia to get them?
Literally curing cancer. You ppl are regarded.  https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/02/15/1067904/ai-automation-drug-development/amp/
Pause
🤣
Sorry, are you implying that the A100 is somehow more valuable than everything that broadcom makes combined?
 The A100 is  just an overpriced gaming card with passive cooling and better RAM. It is not much faster than the RTX 4090 on many AI benchmarks.
They sound like 2020 TSLA bears
so if you hear about Apple you should buy Skyworks? And if you hear about Mcdonald’s you should buy Heinz?
You don’t actually believe that right? In any case, Investors and fund managers alike carefully consider various financial indicators and financial models when making investment decisions (Yes even for your 401k or when balancing a portfolio for Vanguard.) While an influx of capital can impact valuation metrics, such as price-to-earnings (P/E) or price-to-sales (P/S) ratios, investors aim to identify companies with strong fundamentals, growth potential, and attractive valuation ratios. These ratios help gauge a company’s relative valuation compared to its earnings or sales, offering valuable insights for investors.  Market capitalization remains a vital indicator in assessing a company’s relative value and investor sentiment. Financial ratios, such as P/E and P/S, provide additional insights into a company’s valuation.
The timing & wording of his replies are pretty strange too tbh
It definitely is. He also claims AMD with nearly 500 PE has a lower PE ratio than NVDA.
Seemed clearly AI written but too long, probably AI assisted
Overbought
Closer to $400 overvalued. When it finally crashes it will a total bloodbath.
Google already has a better product in their TPU
NVDA doesn't even have the best product as it is right now
AMD has better datacentre hardware. But NVDA has better software (which is the main reason why it has much higher use).
Yes. And cyclical stocks, while leading indicators demonstrate a slowing economy, the hawkish fed and at best a “Growth Recession” inbound.. is not the place to be.
AVGO acquired the company I worked for in late 2013. At the time the stock was around $57ish. At close on Friday it was $867. So what, like a 1500% rise in the past decade…. I’m not complaining
What time frame?  And while 26% up might sound good, it's not if other direct comparisons are up much more.  I hold NVDA and it's up 143% since I bought it late last July.  A quick glance at a comparison of AVGO and NVDA and NVDA is up more than 3x AVGO in the last 6 months, more than double in the last year, has a 44% higher return over the last 5 years, and 55% higher over the last 10 years.  So while you made some money on AVGO, you could've made much more on NVDA.  That said, now's probably not the time to get into either of them, but then I'm not exiting either (but I'm a regard and don't have a clue what I'm doing!)
NVIDIA chips are all manufactured by TSMC.
GPUs are NOT general purpose computer hardware.  Even with their use in compute they're a specialized chip.  And as the other guy said, Nvidia doesn't manufacture them.
Broadcom Unveils Industry’s Highest Performance Fabric for AI Networks  https://www.broadcom.com/company/news/product-releases/61156  Broadcom releases chip for wiring together AI supercomputers  (https://www.reuters.com/technology/broadcom-releases-chip-wiring-together-ai-supercomputers-2023-04-18/)
Watch when none of Nvidia's bullshit projections actually end up in the manufacturing facilities of TSMC
Maybe we’re becoming the house.

No matter how AI shapes the world, it’s crucial to understand that the primary beneficiaries might not be semiconductor manufacturers, such as Nvidia. Instead, the companies directly providing AI services are likely to capture the greatest financial rewards. While semiconductors play a vital role in AI products, the real value lies in the services and solutions enabled by AI, rather than the underlying hardware itself.  To put it simply, it’s analogous to owning McDonald’s versus owning the bread or packaging they use. The true value lies in the complete service ecosystem offered by a company, which encompasses the AI technologies, data analytics, automation, and personalized recommendations.  When you first heard of ride-share companies. Would you like to own Uber or the companies in the gas and auto industries?
Earnings and PE matters but that’s not the whole picture. Story is more powerful than earnings. What is the earning of Bitcoin? 0. It went 10000x in less than 10 years. Thank about that.

the rise of Tesla was backed by the most perfect economic conditions for investors.   Quantitative easing, 0% Interest Rates, Record growth. On top of that consumers had less ways to spend so invested.   that’s the exact opposite of what’s going on now. Quantitative tightening and restrictive monetary policy. Credit conditions tightening as well as Interest rates at restrictive levels.   You add that to slowing economic growth. There will not be another Tesla rise, not right now.
Google could eat their lunch in the AI space by simply choosing to license their existing TPU to other customers.
Why are we still using GPU specific language like CUDA?
NVDA doesn't even make much in terms of actual revenue, let alone earnings. They are just a severe bubble
Stock prices and market capitalization are distinct concepts. The price of a stock does not necessarily reflect its value. In fact, a stock with a lower price can still be more expensive than another stock. Market capitalization VS. Stock prices.
yeah just about. P/S at 38.55 for NVDA and 10.79 for AVGO.
Of course, but they do mostly wireless and ethernet chipsets and I don't think they manufacture.  So AVGO (Broadcom) might be talked about in the context of Intel, MediaTek, Realtek, Atheros, and Qualcomm (that also have products in this space), stuff like that, but probably not with the foundries.
Tesla could be the perfect example of Warren Buffet advice to invest in "good business that even a idiot could run it, because eventually one will".  That is even stronger when the idiot has built a cult of personality.
Best of luck fellow regard!
Regards when they become so regarded they do basic risk management strategies
Just say you hold AVGO and want a NVDA/TSLA level of parabolic rise so you can profit from it faster instead of waiting for 1-2 year time span. Downplaying something that already happened to make your bet look like the "next big thing" just makes you look desperate and annoying. Nobody doubt AVGO is going to benefit from AI in the first place.

How to conduct DD in 2023: review number of times AI was mentioned in earnings calls
Posted the same minute? Wild  Edit: I'm blind, still 2 minutes is impressive.
Dude, you obviously like AVGO … fuck off and make your bet on them
Change the ticker to AIVGO and then maybe I’ll consider buying this all terrain go cart company you speak of.
VMware was an awful buy...
Inflation makes the valuations reasonable
Thanks! Sounds like a compliment to me!
I'm seeing AAPL as exceedingly durable but on the basis of their product ecosystem: big, but only as big as apple can define and execute on. NVDA and TSLA on the other hand are propped up as the gateway to a whole new sector that can be far bigger than what a single company can do.   Either way I'm not standing in front of those freight trains.
The 20 RTX series had a mixed reception too and most people swore it wasn't worth upgrading from 1070/1080s or even 980s. And then the 30s series came out and it was the hottest shit.
Woh 40k a pop. That almost makes no dent in an overpriced 1t cap overpriced dtoxk
This article literally proves nothing. When cancer is cured we’ll see. So many times that shit has been promised. Was promised years ago when voodoo cards were out and people were doing their best to get one credit towards protein bending nonsense. Nothings changes besides hype. I need to see ai do something t besides an article saying it could do something.
NVDA’s market cap implies all I need too.
Still haven’t answered who else is making them besides NVDA?
A100 is literally 3 years old and based on a different process. H100 is the 4090 equivalent is far more scalable and suitable for data centers than the latter.
They do, but most of these evaluations were common many decades ago when stock investments were done by a small percentage of people. Now, if you have a professional job, you are investing. The pool of money in the market is massive beyond comprehension, you can't hold companies to a standard from 40 years ago.  The ratio of the market value vs GDP is floating between 140-190% in the last year. 10 years ago it was averaging closer to 80%. I'd wager it was much lower longer ago but I can't find those numbers through a quicker search at the moment.
Passive index funds don't even *consider* fundamentals. Their only investment criteria is market cap. The result is big companies tend to become massively overvalued and small companies are undervalued.
Which is why they still buy nvidia gpus... wait a minute
So who does?
Not for GPUs.
Yup, by the time the earnings recession hits, it'll be too late for the people initiating positions now to get out.     We are seeing shades of the Dotcom Era but most retail investors are absolutely clueless about anything but 0DTE or buying weeklies to get max leverage.
Bought it 3-4 months ago
What is the point of this comment, that the OP should go back in time and buy NVDA or that broadcom is a bad investment? I might be missing it, can you clarify?
"With the introduction of the Nvidia GeForce 8 series and new generic stream processing units, **GPUs** became more **generalized** **computing** devices. Parallel **GPUs** **are** making **computational** inroads against the CPU, and a subfield of research, dubbed GPU **computing** or GPGPU for **general** purpose **computing"**  &#x200B;  Have you not paid attention to the last 10 years of crypto and machine learning all doing general compute on gpu?
The software 99% of AI researchers use is written for CUDA all those chips are useless for most people
That is a networking chip and not a gen AI chip. It's like saying Michelin tire competes with Ford, makes zero goddamn sense and just makes you look dumb.
Yet it's still up.
I need to set a reminder for my comment, multiple downvotes is usually good sign for predictions
Literally still no idea what that is. That’ll tell you how close they are to nvda
So basically own NASDAQ? Like half NA? or maybe a Semiconductor ETF?
 Market has ignored the news of the economy so many times these past 2 quarters.US economy is more resilient because we was predicting more worse days, but forecast was wrong so the market sentiment jumped up.I am not saying economy is doing super good and your point of quantitative easing and dovishness of fed in early 2021 didn’t made any impact, it does pushed us to the recession which we are hardly avoiding. But what i want to state is, we are here to make money of the people sentiments and following the momentum right now I didn’t saw any trigger which can hit the sell off trigger.Yes, things will come to its mean sooner or later but when who knows? So just follow momentum and make money but yes, if your investing for long term then you shouldn’t care about macroeconomics indicators just sit and watch your tree grow
Tesla only exists because of federal tax credits
I don’t think people understand. Even if someone uses an AMD gpu or TPU. Nvidia owns high speed networking also. It’s obvious nvidia is playing to own the entire stack. And they’re very close. To be fair, any HPC built today is using nvidia tech somewhere. Can’t forget about the software side also. It’s nearly impossible to build anything competitive other than a desktop without incorporating nvidia. But ya, TPU is neat and everything.
Because SYCL doesn't have enough market share?
He’s definitely not an idiot at all…look at what he has done and accomplished…just because you may not agree with his opinions, doesn’t mean he is an idiot.  In fact, all of his businesses (yes…to include Twitter) are doing better than ever.  Twitter was losing millions per week before he took over and started reducing expenses (i.e., employees working three hours a day remotely without a direct impact to bottom line).  Musk is a genius and doesn’t put up with any resemblance of laziness or apathy…awesome!
With regards to that, I believe the more regarded response is “break a leg.” But what do I know, someone told me I had room temperature IQ.
Full disclaimer: I don’t hold AVGO.

Yeah. There is a cycle. However, gamers don't "love" Nvidia or defend it based on arbitrary concepts like people do with Apple or Tesla.  The facts are that Nvidia really have superior technology.
You always have to jump two generations to really make it worth the upgrade.
!remindme 5 years
The primary reason why gaming GPUs aren't used has very little to do with scalability.  It  is because the NVDA EULA specifically *prohibits* gaming cards being used in commercial datacentres. \[This is ignored by some budget cloud providers who simply act as a market for individuals selling GPU access.\]  NVDA has huge problem because they offer CUDA support on all models. They have also merged the RTX and workstation drivers. This means gaming GPU  cannibalise enterprise sales because they offer 3-5x better cost/performance than enterprise GPUs. The only 'defence' NVDA has is crippling RAM and data bandwidth. \[The latest NVDA mid-tier gamings cards are  very mediocre as a result. \]  NVDA also bans the production of RTX 4090 blower type GPUs which can be used in rack servers and workstation \[Unbranded models are readily available on the Asian grey market.\]  The latest NVDA scam is restricting VRAM to ludicrously low levels (eg 8GB) to stop discourage cheap RTX cards, like the 4070, being used being used for ML and workstation use.  AMD gets around the cannibalisation problem by limiting ROCm support to a tiny number of 'pro' GPU models.
That doesn't quite follow, since the relative weighting of the investments in the companies are also by market cap, so they shouldn't inflate or deflate companies based on their size, but only by whether they are in or out of the index.    Take two companies, sized 750 and 250 and to keep things simple let us assume they are the only ones in the index.  When 100 dollars are invested in the index, 75 goes to the 750 and 25 to the 250, so their relative sizes don't change.  750/250 = 3, 825/275 = 3.  Of course if it is a large cap index and leaves out the market cap 10 microstock, well, that stayed 10 while the other two rose, this is what I mean when I say the only distortion would be between what is in or out of the index.  But even then, not everyone is an index investor, so if stocks in the index are truly overbought, then we would expect non-index investments to stay away from the index, and hence prefer other stocks bringing them into parity.  Markets aren't perfectly efficient, but they are efficient...
No it's mainly better performance and software, but amd is getting there slowly.
The thread is about how investing in AVGO is better than NVDA (which going forward very well *might* be true) but then the poster I replied to, who is NOT the OP, was bragging about being up 26% (which of course is no guarantee of future success) when they could've been up 37%.  SO merely pointing out that the brag isn't really what it could've been, it's still great, but could've been better.  Of course going forward either one could outperform the other, or they could both perform the same.
Twitter wasn't making money then and it definitely isn't making money now with an extra 1bn of interest per year to make up
I know a thing or two about physics and a lot about computer science. For years I never paid attention to what he was doing or promising.  When he started talking about AI and self driving, a thing that I was working at the time, I was surprised by how much BS he was talking.  Then I looked at the other business and how absurds were his claims.  And he failed every time.
Elon was conning with all that “Twitter was weeks away from bankruptcy” bs. The company was cash-flow positive when it wad public, aside from all those darn stock-based comp they were handing out.
This post is sarcasm right? Musk is literally running Twitter into the ground and would have done the same with Tesla if it wasn't for the fact it's a product that sells itself.
So is your stance then that you think AVGO is fairly valued, while NVDA is over-valued?  And you're using AVGO as a comparative frame of reference to illustrate NVDA's over-valuation?  Because otherwise if you thought AVGO was under-valued and posted DD on it, I'm confused as to why you wouldn't want to own a stake in it.

You say that like NVDA isn’t constantly improving as well. AMD is unlikely to ever catch NVDA who has much deeper expertise in this area.   There are middleware layers that port some of this stuff but even then the top of the line AMD hardware only performs at 73% of the benchmarked performance of NVDA A100s.   NVDA’s new H100 is 6.7x better than A100s. The performance of AMDs equivalent MI300x is unknown and is yet to enter production let alone have a ported software stack for the leading ML frameworks.
OP can mean the original commenter of the comment thread, which is who you WERE responding to, and you're just trying brag to someone agreeing with the post. Dumb
How has he failed? He pretty much single handedly revolutionized the electric cad industry
“Failed every time”…on what?  Said he wanted to revolutionize the EV market…and he did.  Said he wanted to revolutionize rocket boosters…and he did.  Said he wanted to buy Twitter and revamp…and he is in the process of doing it (?).  Ummm…do you not view him as a successful business owner and visionary?  Seriously?  Lol…
Lol - not sarcasm at all.  Do you even know the history of Tesla?  He is the reason for their success…and don’t even get me started how he created a space company with reusable boosters from the ground up…think about that.  He is ahead of NASA (which now relies on SpaceX) I. That regard.  And define “running Twitter into the ground?”  Twitter still exists, he is revamping it (which will take years), he hired a new CEO and (thank God)…he is mandating his employees to give 110%.  Sure…ANY major corporate changes will result in temporary setbacks, but the company was doomed before he took over…it was bleeding $$$ and there were tons of employees doing…well, very little.  The remaining employees and particularly engineers who WANT to work and achieve something love it.  The others…well…they don’t live it and who cares.
Nvidia has deeper expertise?  Since when?  It's hilarious watching wallstreetbets talk about this stuff, blissfully unaware of anything that happens in the industry.  If they knew anything about this stuff they would have been saying what they're saying now at least ten years ago.  CUDA is from 2007.  AMD has had a different approach to their long term planning around compute, heading towards heterogeneous compute (e.g. old 2013 article: [https://www.zdnet.com/article/a-closer-look-at-amds-heterogeneous-computing/](https://www.zdnet.com/article/a-closer-look-at-amds-heterogeneous-computing/)).  While I still agree that CUDA is a moat, it's a stream now while 10 years ago it was the Nile.  If someone wanted to be forward-looking today, they might be looking at SYCL and other accelerators than just GPUs.  Even though those may also use CUDA, the key factor is how easy it is to offload compute to other units, whether they're OpenCL GPUs or Xilinx (AMD) FPGAs, or anything else.    When it comes to raw hardware performance, AMD doesn't have that much of an issue trading blows with Nvidia if it wants to, but what is the point of putting out a high priced card at performance parity when most will buy the Nvidia card for Cuda anyway, especially in that high end part of the market.  AMD will need to breach that moat first if it wants to compete with high end hardware.  I really don't think AMD has any failings of hardware knowledge or node technology holding them back there, it's just a matter of what products make sense in their market position.
I did NOT reply to the OP (Monarchtrader), which would be the person that started this thread, I replied directly to the poster (dhruvextrous) about their comment.  And as for your assertion that I was "just trying brag to someone agreeing with the post", I was actually doing the exact opposite.  The poster I was replying to was bragging, and I was pointing out it's not really a brag at all, nor does it in anyway help anyone going forward.  I see you feel the need to interject yourself into this sub-conversation with accusations while not understanding the context of multiple posts (by multiple people) or being able to follow the thread's order (i.e. who's replying to whom and about what), so I'll make it easier for both of us and just ignore you.   Please do me the courtesy and do the same.
how
He was at the right place at the right moment.  There are nothing revolutionary on Tesla cars.
By... making and selling electric cars? Revolutionary, how come noone in the industry of making and selling electric cars ever thought of that
What is revolutionary about Tesla EV? They have the exact same technology as any other electric motor we have been using for the last 40 years.  Your electric toothbrush might have a more advanced engine than a Tesla.  There are nothing special about Tesla cars.  Their success was a great deal of right timing, marketing and brand cult.  They were at the right position to get California and USA tax incentives, and didn't have the unions and regulations that were killing traditional American Car companies.  And SpaceX was a similar story. They are reusing decades old designs and poaching Nasa engineers while getting tax incentives to replace things Nasa could do for 60 years.
You are wrong in so many levels, it is embarrassing.  Elon never started any company, he bought himself in.
Ever hear of hyperloop?
Sycl isn't a hardware accelerator from what I know. Anyway you are completely correct on that wallstreetbets is shit and knows nothing about the actual Industry.
Man the people on this website make me really wonder sometimes
The fact that he has sold orders of magnitude more than any other electric vehicle l?
Don’t forget about that $465 million government loan in 2008 to a Tesla corp with nothing but a concept. As the POTUS said 4 years later: You didn’t build that!”
> Their success was a great deal of right timing, marketing and brand cult.  and exploiting that sweet, sweet Chinese "not slave" labour. He was one of the first people to pay a visit to daddy Xi while US and China fight among themselves (others include Apple's Tim Cook, and Bill Gates). When you can operate your businesses for a dime and charge $10 for it, no shit you're going to make bank.
You're insane if you think NASA could make resumable rocket boosters, let alone for the past 60 years or for their prices. NASA doesn't do anything themselves, they set out hyperspecific mission parameters and let Boeing sell them an overpriced solution  NASA stopped that, said "we need to get humans to the ISS, good luck" and SpaceX sold them that for a good price. 10x cheaper if some studies are to be believed
Musk became the CEO of Tesla 2008 (after being their largest shareholder) and was the chief architect of the Tesla Roadster (their first EV)…he undoubtably was the reason for Teslas success…after working his ass off through countless manufacturing challenges and almost going bankrupt.  He also founded SpaceX in 2002 after his interest in Mars.  Im guessing you don’t like his political views and can’t stand the thought of his success in both those endeavors…here’s a question…if he didn’t exist, would Tesla and SpaceX exist today.  I think not.  Love him or hate him…guy is a visionary and has done the impossible several times over.  How about you…you own a space company?  How am I wrong on any of these fronts?  Lol-you are just a hater.
Do you know what "orders of magnitude" means?  [2022](https://www.google.com/amp/s/insideevs.com/news/651978/world-top-ev-oem-sales-2022q4/amp/)
They did made reusable rockets it was called the Space Shuttle.
I don't care about his political views. He is just dumb. He knows nothing about physics or computer science.  He has been burning other people's money for 2 decades.  None of the things you listed are innovations that hadn't existed before.  Even the ridiculous Hyperloop was a repackage of a century old idea. And it failed (burning other people's money again).  SpaceX launches are not 10x cheaper than traditional ones. They might be exact the same price when you factor out the taxes credits and handouts.  His track record is terrible.
https://electrek.co/2022/10/18/us-electric-vehicle-sales-by-maker-and-ev-model-through-q3-2022/  Yes I do. Do you?   When your market share is 2/3 of the market….and yet people say your an idiot or your doing it wrong.   Jealous much?
To call the space shuttle reuseable is a big big stretch.  The boosters? Thrown away. The tank? Thrown away. Costs for a single launch? At least 450 million!  Not to mention that it killed 14 people  I get it, the space shuttle was the cool thing from your youth (it was mine too) but it just kinda sucked in a way that Falcon 9 does not
Sounds good…we can agree to disagree.
The Space Shuttle promises were as outlandish as SpaceX but since it was a public funded project we new how bad things were going.  SpaceX is hiding the true price of their launchers and they are a full decade behind their initial promises.  Also, remember when Elon said Starship would be launching every two weeks in 2022?  It is 2023 and they can barely launch one.  SpaceX is a scam burning taxpayer and venture capital money.
SpaceX is operationally profitable. Starship R&D is a huge money sink but investors are okay with it and Starlink is making a lot of money for them  Falcon 9 exists now, is cheap now, is profitable now. All the taxpayer money NASA and the DoD give to SpaceX are for services that SpaceX is currently providing. They've got many successful crewed and uncrewed missions under their belt for the govt  And even if they're a decade behind (which sounds like an insane statement already from the beginning) they are still miles ahead of any competition
It is profitable because all the government handouts and tax incentives.  Starlink is a joke.  Nasa, back in de 50s and 60s achieved much more in less time than SpaceX in the last 20 years.  This privatization of space exploration was a total failure. People need to realize how much taxpayer money was burned by Musk and others crooks.
At this point you're just making up things. Let's get some real numbers in here  An Atlas V launch costs 109$ million. This is the launcher that the US Gov used the most under the EELV (now NSSL) program. For DART the Falcon 9 costed 69$ million, and we know commercial customers pay not even close to that. SpaceX is profitable on commercial launches alone.  More importantly, SpaceX is able to do this without support from congress or the president. NASA is at their whim but private companies can have stable visions for longer  I'd like to ask you what about privatisation has gone wrong? You already claim it has with confidence while the process has only started yet. Crew launch to the ISS has gone from 450 million to 58 million. What exactly is going wrong with that?
You are using the worst case from Nasa, the Space Shuttle, that was a over-engineered and flexible "work horse" with a much simpler setup.  But even then, it is not 10x cheaper.  I don't understand how delusional a person has to be to believe SpaceX had no support from congress.  The problem with privatization of launches is clear. They didn't lived up to the promises of cheaper and more reliable launchers. Because, as you pointed out, SpaceX has no competition... Because there is no market.  The market is so limited that SpaceX had to invent a complete bullshit product to polute the upper atmosphere with space junk for a market that is also incredibly limited.
I used the Atlas V as a comparison.. which absolutely was the workhorse at the time (the time being 2005 or so)  And trust me, congress wanted SpaceX gone. Richard Shelby famously has devoted so much time to trying to get commercial crew cancelled it's wild  You're also delusional to not see a market for space launches. It's growing fast, every year more
Atlas V costs $109mil and have a very good track record.  https://www.ulalaunch.com/rockets/atlas-v#:~:text=Get%20to%20Space%20Safely%20and,systems%20and%20key%20commercial%20assets.
I know that Atlas V has a good track record, and Falcon 9 block 5 is *also* 100% reliable, but has more data points to back it up  So what's the argument there?
It is not 10x cheaper.
Your point being?  "Oh no! What a great failure! We only managed to make it 40% cheaper instead of 90%!!!"
He promised it would be 10x cheaper and multiple times quicker to launch than traditional rockets.  20 years later, nowhere near that goal.

Just purchased about $40 worth of Hot Dogs, Chili, and Baked Beans at the grocery store.   For some reason, I've been having great success in losing weight with these items as the main staple of my diet, so I might as well keep it going.   This is enough food for like 3 weeks, and with lunch being $20 at a restaurant lately it seems like a real bargain.
From the Bobby sub: “How would the world change if there are 66.000 more millionaires?  They probably do not want to let this happen, but the squeeze is imminent and we have never been closer before, so I wonder how the world will change after shorts covered and we all get millions when selling our shares.  This is the hedgies worst nightmare having a few more millionaires on this world, so they dragged it out and shaked a good amount of paperhands that will miss the squeeze.  The world would be a much better place when we are all millionaires.  Yes, there might be 66.000 more lambos driving on the street, but I also read alot of wholesome ape posts about trying to help people with the money and donate a lot.  So how would the world change if all 66.000 members on this sub would suddenly have millions of $ in their bank account?  I can't wait to buy everyone in my family a house, give food to homeless people and just try to make the world a better place.”

Don’t know how hard is it to wait a bit until tech goes on a downtrend to start shorting with your entire port.  At some point, analyst price targets can only bring up a seriously overbought stock like NVDA. Can’t wait until it falls like $30 in a day, probably after the ban of selling to a China is finalized

“Say you have a dog, but you need to create a duck on the financial statements. Fortunately, there are specific accounting rules for what constitutes a duck: yellow feet, white covering, orange beak. So you take the dog and paint its feet yellow and its fur white and you paste an orange plastic beak on its nose, and then you say to your accountants, ‘This is a duck! Don’t you agree that it’s a duck?’ And the accountants say, ‘Yes, according to the rules, this is a duck.’ Everybody knows that it’s a dog, not a duck, but that doesn’t matter, because you’ve met the rules for calling it a duck.”  -TSLA Corporate Handbook

 Hi, I’m The People’s Bard, and this is my ticker-conscious weekend update, from a real live middle class American.  WEBR grill was amazing again tonight, perfectly grilling mustard glazed pork chops and BBQ chicken. I’m generally not impressed by typical man/dad stuff, but I’ve loved that grill since the moment I got it. My model is the [Spirit II E-310](https://www.weber.com/US/en/gas/spirit/spirit-ii-e-310-gas-grill/45010001.html).  Having AMZN Alexa in my kitchen has been great, but the app—which you need to connect, turn on skills, change settings—is truly garbage. Things you change frequently don’t take, and the UI is needlessly busy. I thought my wife was going to murder Alexa today.  At SBUX today my venti cold brew was refilled for free just because I showed the app on my phone? I had no idea I could get a second cold brew for free. Also, it’s just reliable. I prefer mom and pop coffee places, and they rank in my favorites, but sometimes those places suck. They’re serving brown water. The floor at Starbucks is just reliably high, even if the ceiling is low.  COST sends us this monthly magazine, and I looked through it for the first time today, and I really liked some of the articles and recipes. It wasn’t just a catalog/ads like I expected.  Ticker watch: Had Abbott’s Frozen Custard for the first time today, and I’ll be investing if they ever go public. The custard was among the best I ever had (Oreo cheesecake flavored), but the real treat was their frozen peanut butter chocolate “turtle” served on a popsicle stick. Moan worthy.

I think if someone had $200k cash and sold options with it, that’s enough to probably never work again.  Given a frugal lifestyle and playing their positions right..  You could make $5k-$10k per month no problem.  And it would compound.
When TSLA hits 270, sell a july 28 call for $1000 or higher, then collect when it drops back down to $230ish

Tesla puts at open
TSLA is going to drop. - Welcome to my Ted Talk
I've already made over 50k profit for buying and selling IONQ contracts when it's share price was around 5.50$. I now have positions i had bought outright, around their fair value @ 9.60ish. There has been some huge 40% gains since then, which could be a short squeeze or just quantum computing hype. But I have looked at the numbers and they have really improved their future guidance and secured amazing growth. Also worth mentioning they seem to have enough capital to become profitable without having to dilute investors or taking on dept. About 3 years worth. I would also encourage you to research the basic science of quantum computing and research their potential "society evolving" applications. With the emergence of AI and self learning algorithms, I hypothesize they start incorporating these algorithms with Quantum computing technology. I've also read that IONQ has been working with the US military to incorporate them in their systems... this large share price may not hold up in the short-term, but i am expecting big things from them in the future

What we are about to experience is the total failure of the capitalist system. What we saw in 1929 and more recently with the coronavirus pandemic will be walks in the park. Human society will have a reckoning moment with total chaos that will make people kill each other competing for food, energy and jobs. The next global financial crisis is much closer than you think!

Analysts are borderline useless; wondered why the analyst didn’t mention a substantial decrease in gross margin and EV tax credit being temporary.

Are we though? Aside from MercadoLibre what exactly do they have to offer, from a degen standpoint? None of their stock offerings are anywhere near triple digits, despite massive flips over the past 5 years, they offer a few banks, a couple of electric companies, a solo telecom company, like two industrials and an agricultural company as per our ability to trade them with ease on American brockers that aren't majorly OTC or plummeting waist deep into S.A. trading that will flag you as an American trader and there's no way that's any good.  I like the perspective, would love the opportunity to trade some world markets as an American without a target made out of dollar signs, unlike the open door we give to foreign traders on our own market, but the way it is we as Americans just don't get the practicality we give to others, then it becomes burdensome nonsense we ain't got time for.  I'm all for shorting the fuck out of the Philippines if you can get some ease of use on foreign markets for us

Bruh cruises are so awesome  I wish they built them on land
Big population of seniors love them.
I feel like all the reddit losers hating cruises never been on one.  Its a floating resort with virtually unlimited food that stops at a different beach every day with different things to do at that beach.
Old people lol

Cruises are fun. Basically an amusement park with rides, Broadway shows, food, casinos, and nice looking women

Hello friend,  Just a friendly heads-up, let's try to keep it chill and avoid using the Lord's name in vain. It's all about respect and vibes, you know? Gotta create a positive and inclusive space for everyone to vibe together.  Instead of "God D***", find alternative phrases such as "Goodness gracious" or "Golly gee".  I'm here to educate, not hate. I want to assure you that my intention is to spread positivity and not to cause offense. I hold deep respect for all faiths, even when our beliefs differ, and I am open to engaging in respectful discussions that foster mutual understanding. Let us embark on this journey together, embracing kindness and love as our guiding principles.  *1 Peter 3:8-9 (NIV): "Finally, all of you, be like-minded, be sympathetic, love one another, be compassionate and humble. Do not repay evil with evil or insult with insult. On the contrary, repay evil with blessing, because to this you were called so that you may inherit a blessing."*  ---    ^This ^message ^was ^sent ^automatically. ^Did ^I ^make ^a ^mistake? ^Let ^me ^know ^by ^sending ^me ^a ^direct ^message.

It's the only way most people will be able to afford housing each month. Lengthening mortgage terms only just inflates asset values even further and makes the generational wealth gap larger and permanent.
120 year fixed armed double mortgage rate adjustable zero interest for the first 66 years
Not until we have 50 year treasuries.  Way before we have 50 year mortgages, we will have bifurcated 99 year land leases under new houses, to make home ownership more affordable...
We already have them in Canada. People couldn't afford the new rates on their adjustable mortgages because payments doubled in some cases, so the govt passed a law for banks to stretch those mortgages, and now we have 70+ yrs mortgages here. Apparently there's even some 90yrs mortgages out there now. This is for people in their 30s too. It's happening
Generational mortgages. 👀

You're not intelligent, you're autistic
Is this copy pasta? Lmao
It's called knowing when to relax and have fun. Everyone in my family is pretty educated, they all have at least a master's degree, some are doctors, some engineers or lawyers. When we gather, we talk about whatever is going on with each other's lives, we crack jokes at each other, sometimes we debate politics or economics, but its merely an accident, and it's usually towards the end when all the fun subjects have been exhausted. And even then, it's not that serious, everyone is looking for an opportunity to make fun of the matter. Spending time with family is about family, it's not about trying to prove you are smarter than everyone else.   Trust me I've been to family gatherings of someone else's family when all they did was pontificate on politics and debate, or talk about their jobs or fields of study (respectable ones I'll give them that), but they did that the whole time, and it was so miserable. It was interesting, but it wasn't fun, felt like a lecture, and you could see everyone was sort of competing to sound smarter than others. They took themselves so seriously you couldn't joke about anything, and they sounded pretentious af. It made me appreciate my goofier and easy going family. Don't take yours for granted
Lol you and I both, a lot of simple people out there
It's simply because they're done trying and for better or worse they are happy with who they are at the moment. I find that depressing and terrified to end up like them some day

Buy as many CCL as possible a month out, $3-5 above current market price, for about $0.25 each. For every $1.15 CCL rises, your option value doubles.  Leave it there for about a week, but keep an eye out for any bad news like kids being throw overboard, icebergs, or zombie infections.  Your option value will likely double. Rinse and repeat. Sell and do it again.  Then on a pale blue night, sacrifice a cat in the name of Jesus Christ the Devil warrior, preferably on public property - like a church, and spell out the following words in a circular pattern with scented candles from Bed, Bath, and Beyond...backwards in Aramaic: Money, Power, Fortune, and Heretic.  This will summon a Seven Headed Dragon that will crash the market causing World War 3 and 4 simultaneously.   World poverty will wreck the world.   Your measly $600 profit will quadrouple, quintople in sentimental value.

Mike Wilson was only off by $130 on his initial SPY price prediction of $320 EOY.  I’m not a permabear but 7 mega cap tech market carrying the market on speculation about AI is incredibly unhealthy as retail are pretty much just trying to time the top

Lower decks if you watch star trek is pretty funny because it essentially makes fun of the series with sorta inside jokes on Paramount.  Air disasters is good also on Paramount.   PeaCOCK has psych which is like 10 years old but pretty funny. Sorta like scrubs or the office style of show but it's 2 guys who start a psychic detective agency and solve crime. Neither are actually psychic  Arguably all worth watching depending on mood. Air disasters is a great background show. Psych is good in general and lower decks is good for a quick sorta funny show

I'm a bear. Not delusional though.  Don't sell now... but manage risk... the market hasn't priced in unemployment... every company that has reported is struggling with margins. Too much aggregate hiring over the last year... the tight labor market is gonna loosen up from layoffs -> consumer data is gonna tank -> Housing defaults gonna go up -> top line revenue will go down from a weaker consumer. Either this earnings or next you'll see companies getting gutted for missing estimates by a hair  Put an election year on top of it and it should be pretty choppy at best till 2025ish  You're fine for the short term though. And you can still buy dips... and if they overestimate (covid) you might even get paid from bad news.
Competition is already here.  If I had money and a good job, I'd get a MB EQS instead of a Tesla... But Tesla has a lead in EV volume, BYD is the only one that seems to be giving it a fight on the volume right now...  But eventually they'll get there... Or not... Who knows!!?!?!  That's the exciting part About the horse races, I mean, stock market!

a woman can use almost any type of BC except for combined methods right after birth, even when breastfeeding. We put IUDs in people right after they deliver sometimes, lol. Progestrone only pills are an awesome choice for that, as well as IUDs and the nexplanon  Plus, women who exclusively breastfeed are far less fertile. Exclusive breastfeeding is actually considered a form of birth control with like a 98% success rate

What's it pay if they win it? How much was the bet?  10 to 1 now.   X to 1 if they actually win
If it is good enough to post about, it is good enough to take profit.

My favorite part about dividends is actually buying cool stuff with my portfolio instead of all this back and forth; what cool stuff did you buy with your portfolio?! If it’s just a big number who cares? All this talk of just sell shares to get your own dividend; ok, but who is selling shares and getting cool stuff forever? Dividend stocks are the only stocks you can buy and hold forever; everything else gets sold to the greater fool later, always later, maybe next year you can retire etc

5 things to know what a right trade is?
better than a hole in your palate.
Cuz you’re damaging your nose every line or bump. When the numbness wears off pain arrives and your body tries to fix your nose and sometimes itll bleed. Although I’ve found that usually only happens if you don’t break it up into a fine enough powder. Rocks will damage your nose way worse than a fine powder.
It’s a blood thinner and those particles shooting into your nostril are doing damage. The blood is going to come out of the microscopic tears inside your nose before anywhere else. Would you prefer bleeding out of your ears or penis hole instead?
You’re supposed to mainline it into your arm/leg/groin, not your nose, silly!

Point at your dick
When she does it again. Turn to your friend, nod your chin upward, and ask "Threesome?" see response. If you need safety in your question take four shots before asking.
You want to accuse your friend's girlfriend of hitting on you.  What could possibly go wrong?  "Stop touching my arm.  You're making me uncomfortable."  It'll go great.
Feeling you up as in grabbing your dick?

Thanks for your submission!  r/WallStreetBets is ultimately a community about making money through trading, and our conversations should shift around that.  Politics are fundamentally intertwined with making money, and political actions almost always have an impact on financial markets.  Still, we need to make sure that when we have these discussions, we're explicitly calling out the financial impacts of the politics we're discussing. Otherwise, the conversation can very easily veer off into flamewars and boring, unproductive, discussion.  Here's an example of a political comment that doesn't offer any value:  * "I hate this new green policy from the Biden administration. What a fucking idiot"  Now compare it to this:  * "I hate this new green policy from the Biden administration. It threatens the profit margins of oil companies because they will need to expand their OpEx. I have calls on Shell that are going to get decimated at open."  The latter is significantly more interesting and offers a great jumping point into market related discussion.  Put succinctly: If you choose to start or engage in arguments about libtards or Nazis instead of making fun of their bad SPY long then you're in the wrong place and we'll show you the door.  If you're not sure if your content is political, it probably is, and there's probably a better way to post it without making things weird.  ---  All that being said, we are here to help. We want to make it as easy as possible for you to post to our community. We have to balance this with making the subreddit interesting for our readers.   If you need some guidance, don't hesitate to [reach out to modmail](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) and we'll give you some pointers!

That’s what we need now.  A trade war with China, right after Tim Apple and Enron Musk went to China lol. TSLA is so dependent on China, Enron even praised BYD, its rival.  Remember that short lived proposal about banning TikTok?  The frickin Chinese government owns stocks; they will damn sure retaliate like they did with Micron.

You must have balls of steel when prices dip. I usually only buy calls too, maybe 90% of the time, but I end up panic selling. Panic selling when something drops and panic selling when something is mooning because I want to lock in profits.  Last week was my worst. I sold a $260c on TSLA that expired 7/7 when it was dropping last Monday.  I also sold a $412c on NVDA when it was at $416 on Friday, 45 minutes later it was at $424.  Mental health in the shitter this weekend.

I was just wondering if I had $100 bucks to toss on some options. Going for higher strikes than reasonable but knowing I was just betting on a strong move and selling early. Like I know it won't reach the strike. Was wondering if it was a better bang for the buck betting on SPY or Apple (or some other company).
Anyone that understands cults and options chains would be silly to short Tesla. The score 200:1 to bulls.

I think the bank is willing to take less for cash, so the seller gets a bit more.
Also a LOT less risk for the seller. A financed offer can always be pulled by the lender for a variety of reasons (whether real or influenced by the buyer). A cash offer has a much higher likelihood to close as a significant contingency (finance closing) is removed.
Just a quicker way to get the cash. Financing would require 7-10 days to close. Cash offer can be in days and don’t have to worry about banks. Cuts out the middle man

They're all beef uncured hot dogs, so although hot dogs aren't the healthiest option these are as good as it gets.
The Hot Dogs are actually uncured, so you're wrong. And Baked Beans aren't bad for you.  VM, you're getting ahead of yourself.
That's righ,  visualmod!  Eating hot dogs and baked beans does lead to an early death which is why those food items had been included on anti drug campaigns throughout the 70s to 90s but big hot dog got involved and shut down the protesters

You’re right. Instead of seeking a better job we should all get paid at least a million dollars. I’m sure the price of rent and food will stay just as low as it is now and a hamburger for lunch won’t cost $10,000. Just look at how baller we can be in Venezuela or Zimbabwe dame. Living the dream

I'm a longer term trader than that but I like you odds based upon how many calls were bought in the last few weeks, the fact that SPY is showing a possible double top, and the fact the tech has not made new highs and could be putting in a higher low here.   It's not even about a crash anymore. This market is so due for a 10% correction, it's not even funny.

1% of just the US households is 1.3 million. So, times $3500 is $4.5 billion. The headsets only cost $1500 to produce. Killer mark up. And the who knows how much they'll make from the app store. People who can't afford will get loans to get it. Apple will for sure win with it.
The price is like 1/8th of the median US annual income. Obviously people buy things they can't afford but this is well beyond that normal threshold. Ipod and Iphone were never even close to this income ratio and phones are essential whereas this is an extra.

Yeah I saw that, but iam not that worried as that is still far out and there are so many intangibles at play here, anything could happen. In the meantime, I am betting on SA going full regard, something they are very good at. With Russian supply lines damaged, China waking up, our oil reserves at a 40 year low, oil buybacks, etc...I remain bullish. But I always appreciate the feedback, thanks.   Brent prices are just a hair under $75 per barrel today, but recent estimations from the International Monetary Fund suggest that Saudi Arabia’s fiscal breakeven for crude oil is more than $80 per barrel.  Saudi Arabia’s extra cuts go into effect in July, and prices could tick up as supply tightens. After all, the IEA has predicted that crude oil supply will exceed demand by 2 million bpd in the second half of this year.

Trading oil is my life, lol, and yes, I am extremely regarded. I expect the opposite of what people are thinking. Buffet didn't buy most of oxy just for fun, but that's a whole different convo. If crude is going to take off this year, it'll be soon. If not, it's time to short...let's see how this week goes. Imo, crude below 70 is a solid buy, if we see another dip, ill probably load depending on the outcome of this week. Good luck with your future plays, thanks for talking oil, it's one subject I could talk forever about.
And if you ever want to talk oil, dm me. I don't know many other peeps that make a living doing this besides myself, and I love hearing every side. Thanks again, solid chat
My 130s are July 21st, and then I have some January 19th 2024 140s. I expect China to wake up. Last month, they had 4 year record high oil imports. Things are about to get spicy
oh u mean hkd and shit? ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271) that’s most def not chinese billionaires doing  chinese can’t even own stocks on hang seng
I love it when dumb douches like you get fed up with Cali and bail, I hope you took the trash with you, fam
Yeah bro!
Nah, looks like he can
Ngl,  i would wanna see you try

Will do.
"billionaires cannot do a thing"      Man, you belong here.
Who hurt you
Seems like he might have left it behind
![img](emote|t5_2th52|12787)
I would give up and pay someone else to do it
it better have deleted
What's dt lol? Iam mostly on stocktwits, I suck at reddit. Tenaciousbroski is my name there as well.
yeah tell me how billionaires can escape under CBDC   u belong here 🤡
Not my state government

You’re wanna make me do manual labor? I’m going to collect payment.
Sounds good man, it was great chatting with you. There aren't that many oil peeps left, so it's always great talking to one. Take care, and yeah, give me a follow if you ever go on there. Then we can talk oil whenever, lol. Happy 4th buddy
Looks like my calls will print at open. Crude jumped like I thought it would. Have a good day man
ok,  ill run to the atm
That was cash money right there.

Love it, made a small fortune today.
What software did you use for this - it's incredible.
Cable guy was an underrated movie
One of the best movies ever. So underrated.
This is such a mindfuck
Elon??
Glad Elon and Zuck have chosen peace not war. Well done  Edit: In my mind, the girl at 0:41 looks kinda like a deep fake of [college-aged Cathie Wood](https://i.redd.it/buparlgxq2181.jpg)
I'm actually regarded. I failed to notice the deepfake.
AI deepfake fuckery aside, this scene proves how ridiculously talented jim carrey is.

You are such a nerd for this
Summer lovin' on Wall Street, y'all! Let's ride this wave together!
Love this 😎
HOW did you do this?
Is that Aunt Cathie????
Ending was trash.  The Truman Show was just miles ahead
Elon, Biden, will ferell and Zuck.
Don’t forget aunt cathie
Strike and exp?
Because for debit spreads you are buying the more expensive option. They won't move in a 1:1 ratio until they are both ITM
What you are trying to do is unclear
It is so that no one does that spread, check it out for BKNG, spread of 5, priced at 7 and selling is at 3, so you can’t profit from those trades
You don't understand spread. Max profit possible in $1spread is $1. I was expecting, ask to be limited by that $1. Your answer is good for a single call.
Just sell the spread then. Cant go tits up
I'm sure he'll keep that in mind
This have 2 option priced separately. You are trying to buy/sell them together. The ask price is usually higher and bid is usually lower. So the ask price for the spread is ask price for buying side and bid price for the selling side. This is why you can see the spread greater than difference in the strike price. You are probably pricing some deep ITM options.
Can you tell me something about spread?
I’d like to watch but my mom won’t let me cause of the boobie scene.

So my Puts will print then buy Calls - cool
“bullish trend with no signs of stopping”  I saw this and knew your post was probably good DD. I just bought more without reading more and can now can relax. Thx dude
Always bet on America till before the Holiday afterwards it’s back to living paycheck to paycheck. Spy dumps this week.
so that fucker ran flat lol
Yep gonna make bank on 0DTE puts today.
I don’t think it has much downside past 440 today so if that works for your puts, then good. Would not be surprised if we don’t even go that far down
Still doesn’t invalidate the TA. Volume was so low today.
They're friday expry, so I can ride them through the meetings.  It's in a shallow up wave now and I picked up some 0dte calls at the bottom.  Once it shifts down again I'm out regardless on the 0dte with the short day.
Agreed, figured it was gonna be a shit show. We'll see what happens humpday, gonna have some liquidity.
This is the cutest little picture. Look at how happy everyone is.
You forgot the part where the MM’s are the ones making the shovels and selling them to NVDA buyers for $199 first.
I like to buy high and sell low, losing money makes me a better person
When you sell $1000 of shovels per year and your business is valued at $40,000
Try catching a falling knife I dare you
That's actually how Levi's started. The founder sold jeans to miners who didn't make a single dime.
Shovel co is $1T already. How much upside do you think is left
reddit god: how many times will you post this?   wsb degen: yes
The picture is missing the dumpster behind Wendy’s
Feels eerily similar to the AI fintech hype back in 2021. When that idiot went on CNBC and was asked "what does Upstart do?" and pretended he couldn't hear the question, think UPST is -90% since then, bulls were hyping it to replace FICO scores.  AFRM, SOFI, LMND, LC etc... the list goes on. Who knows how long this current AI hype will go on for.
So it’s puts, always the opposite what this subs says thx!
If you missed the boat on NVDA, TSM is the one who is actually selling shovels, NVDA is selling a whole mining operation.  NVDA is limited by silicon supply.
Pretty sure Google and Meta at least have developed their own AI processors and are planning to start producing them "soon".
Fuck yeah this is the kind of pre-GME cryptic no DD post I came here for in the first place, I'm going all in.
So go long AMD, got it! 👍
When opensource replacement of Cuda gets created (seems like there are some). Nvidia will crash. That's because of the many driver limitations and segmentation, while amd is opensource.
I can tell everyone is losing money because you would rather post jokes than analysis.
California gold rush in a nutshell. Go 49ers.
I've been selling NVDA Covered Calls to you guys for a while. Looks like my $450 call expiring next week will be a nice $385 premium for me to keep
On it! I'll dip into my piggy bank and buy calls at 400! 🐷🚀
Profits on shovels are pegged to the iron supply, geniuses. Shovel Inc. can only order a materially limited number of shovels from Taiwan Shovel Manufacturing Co before they run out - Just like they did when bitcoin mining fueled shovel sales.
Intredasting
This picture implies Microsoft, Google and Meta are idiots, when only Meta is.
Take a meaningless award for making the smartest post i've seen all year .... possibly since q2'22 ...
NVDA is only trading 50 times earnings. Cheap I tell you. Cheap!
NVDA will be back down to 200 by eoy and all you dip buyers will be scratching your heads wondering what happened to your favorite AI stock 😂
Or just buy puts now and wait? Both strategies will win eventually 🤷🏾‍♂️
I'm curious how often the chips need to be upgraded or renewed. Once everyone that needs the "AI" chips buys them, what does the upgrade cycle look like. will NVDA's revenue drop off or is there a sustainable revenue stream going forward.
Who sells the shovels to NVDA? That's the play
This looks like a loser.
what is NVIDIA and why is that company called envy?
When the shovel cost 219 PE with 60 forward PE and not the one shovel store in town
 Couldn't agree more, u/hisenbearg! Been watching this closely and it's  looking like a prime opportunity. Remember, folks, no one ever went  broke taking profits. But also, no one ever got to the moon without a  rocket.
Will drop to 250 in 2 months
Google already built their own TPUs to process DeepMind. Apple has their own chips now.  Maybe Microsoft and meta will need to use Nvidia for AI. But google and apple are self sufficient.
ASML making the real shovels
Or just get vgt or QQQM and get everything in the picture?
Please give more advice a decade out of date.
Some dead center of the bell curve shit right here.      It'll work till it doesn't and you all get stomped
To 400 he says ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)  It'll go lower than that.
NVDA is the new Apple. Give it 5 years, almost every one will own something with a NVDA chip in it. A 5T market cap in the next 5 years is a conservative estimate
Fuck yeah. Finally, some clarity.
And Apple is over on its own making its own chips.
No way nvd jumps another 30% earnings again three times in a row
Shhhh don't tell them, I'm riding on crypto and AI, don't ruin it for me
By this 'logic' everybody should be investing in sand mining companies because they provide silica to make chips.
The true price of gold is around +$55,000/oz according to this website:      ***The Inside Story on the Gold-for-Oil Deal that could Rock the World's Financial Centers***   [Another (Thoughts!): The Profound Story of Gold and Oil (usagold.com)](https://www.usagold.com/goldtrail/archives/another1.html)
The IV will go through the roof if we go back to 400. Options won't be cheap anymore, not even calls.
Also Data is.
Somebody gets it !
Nailed it !!
I still don’t get why u need gpus and not cpus for non graphical AI - butt whateva
Good one
ASICs or GPU?
Brace yourselves, we're diving into the world of Wall Street roller coasters!
Looks like even time-traveling investors believe in the power of 400! 😄🚀
When everyone wants market money,  riches, lazy, the easy good life....  SELL COURSES, SUBSCRIPTIONS,  AD REVENUE
Already bought at 134
This is the exact image I have in my head and how I explain why I’m buying more nvidia
Oh I’m ready for the SnP to be under 4k again
TSM + MU is the shovels
Because AI is growing to meet the demanding needs of a growing AI.
Hmm I sold half my shares at $400... I think you're saying this was a poor choice.
Calls it is, and has been
Why isn’t TSM going up then?
Bought gold this is good meme
That's why I stay deep in ASML, even the MMs that make the shovels need the equipment to make them.
Options are the most real time priced things in the market, if there is no risk of buy or sell at 400, the amount of bidding will immediately price it up to a amount that have the appropriate risk for the seller and buyer
Somebody put up a winner ticker. Need a quick come up with low chances of failure. Please lol, spent a bag on my mother for her birthday. Cucked myself in the process.
So everytime get 400 just buy calls? Is that easy?
Therefor
I normally dont advise regards but mosaic just trained on amd/nvidia, iterating between passes and they estimate they can get around 90% relative performance. Do what you will with that information
Come on, start digging for AMD, please!
TSM would be making the said shovels for nvda, isn’t it
Dip? Lol
You save a lot of money when you dig your own grave! Woodworking also helps with making the coffin too, another price point to reduce the cost.  Take the savings and YOLO it into SPY calls, you won't regret it, and even if you do you're prepared!
 Oh for fucks sake
When everyone produce shovels to sell, sell iron...
Lol factss
Nice
Love it
This is why I buy RKLB
OP is so naive it makes this meme even more wholesome
I wish I took the job offer at NVIDIA in 2012 instead of going to grad school. The stock was at $3.00 back then. Even just working there for 2 years, I would have tens of millions now with that RSU comp
Google also makes their shovels and on the fifth generation with the fourth in production.  Meta also working on their own.  Microsoft has also started to.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
and AMD or upcoming ARM suddenly doesn't exist anymore
[shovel your way out of the shit](https://youtu.be/ifGdAcDryXk)
Why not SOXL?
gotdam, why didnt yall tell me these bubbles were so pillowy and soft! havent slept this well in months
Funny thing is that Nvidia doesn’t even manufacture chips.
Yeah but Microsoft and google are also making their own shovels
Is this financial advice?
No way that is bullshit…
![img](emote|t5_2th52|12787)
Nvidia are the shovels?
[Diggy Diggy Hole](https://youtu.be/34CZjsEI1yU)
What happened to the 3rd sack of gold?  Accountant here IRL...
The question is when does the AI bubble burst?
When everyone is selling shovels, I'll let'em hold the bags to go along with them...
Mining for gold*
Hey. Don't forget. Nvidia sells hardware, nvidia needs the software companies to not make useless garbage to run on it, or they lose thier entire value proposition.
Sell shovels and dig gold at the same time, seeing as you're selling them in the first place
All 3 companies in the picture are developing their own shovels, Google actually already have it and a pipeline of new chips to come.   https://www.reuters.com/technology/google-says-its-ai-supercomputer-is-faster-greener-than-nvidia-2023-04-05/  TSMC is actually where the real shovel store is, as no matter what, they have to go to TSMC to manufacture their own chip.
People just follow the AI trend. AI primarilt comes from software not chips. Anyway, good luck to stock surfers 🏄‍♂️
Looking for more chip restriction to bottom out NVDA past support then I buy long and calls and watch my retirement build itself
Ah yes, the classic buy when low, sell when high strategy. Genius.
The shovels are for digging graves.
You forget the ones who make the shovles...
I’ll love to sell the store stand to Nvidia anytime
going to 1000
This is wallstreet top call. Euphoria is running high people are so sure of their plays
Buy ASML then
SOXX if your going long
real
There’s only one king in this town baby, and it’s called ASML.   Without them nvidia and tsmc are just a glorified theoretical engineering company.
Remember the gold miners made the most money , not the picks and shovels
It's the year 2000...   Don't buy Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon...  Buy Cisco!   That's the backbone of the Internet future.
And ASML sells the machines that make the chips that every GPU company sells to these platforms
Why not buy puts and sell when it hits $400 if you’re that confident that’s what will happen?
my new shares in RAD are gonna be able to buy the land the gold is on and allow me to charge people to mine my gold for me. that baby should pop off soon. did yall see what happens when you type rad into faacebook? watch that animation if you dont believe me.
Buy the calls and be ready to unload to regards gotcha
Idk if anyone will see this please help me out school and work is hard anything will help $devking89
AMERICA🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Google and Meta both make their own chips. Not sure about MSFT.
I just realized that they have not shown Amazon, I feel they are selling Lemonade on the next stand.
 If ASML were a company in the USA, the stock price would likely be three times higher. ASML is a crucial player in the semiconductor industry, particularly in the field of lithography machines. Their advanced technology is in high demand, and they hold a dominant market position. As the demand for semiconductors continues to rise, ASML is well-positioned to capitalize on this trend.
google has their own TPU - which i think will probably get a lot more use in the future
Until OP realized that TSMC that is the real shovel store not NVIDIA ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
![img](emote|t5_2th52|18632)
replace the buckets with bags, and this can go right to top of /r/crypto
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)
I'll rug pull myself thank you very much!
MM?
Just buy it all and short squeeze it they said
I think the point is Meta and MSoft and Alphabet are buying hardware like crazy to get in on the AI craze and to service cloud computing needs.   Don't buy the cloud/AI providers, buy the company making the hardware they're buying: NVidia
it's happening right now! RUN for the HILLS!!!!!!
If you own NVDA stock and sell covered calls, does that also count as selling shovels?
That’s right, gives me a reason to cuss out the bill collectors when they call. Easy entertainment
"But don't worry, losing builds character. In fact it's making you a better person right now. A great, big, well-rounded loser with lots of personality."
People said the same thing when Apple’s market cap hit 2T
Charity is good for society
Builds character
It honestly should be considered donations to charity at this point for tax purposes. I just tell myself and others I am a philanthropist set on donating all my current and future wealth to putting hedge fund children through private school.
Thats how I value my LLC as well . Its just good business practice.
couldnt have said it better
But what if you were the only shovel shop in town and the gold rush just started? Fundamentals don’t matter when the future is so unpredictable. If you believe the AI craze is not a fad and will last for more than a couple years, you buy NVDA. a lot of NVDA.. It’s just that simple.
And you are about to enter a trade war with at least two bigger companies.
[deleted]
do what now
Note those old denims are worth a unimaginable amount of money for what those people mined
Phil Knight sold shoes out of the trunk of his car.
None
About 2T
Ask apple
that's where they are heading *downhill*
I remember watching that live and laughing my ass off. His buddies prob bring it up once a week to fuck with him. Funny thing is, most of the shills on CNBC have no clue either.
I'm bullish on Sofi but I don't know about the rest of those.  I'm long on a bunch of them and days when it has a big up day I write some covered calls and just hold.
Mark Minervini is a legend. My fave part of that saga was him doing a burnout in his Lambo and posting it to twitter wirh a "fuck you haters" vibe after people absolutely roasted him for that interview 🤣  Dude is literally too stupid to even look past the ticker name, but he's sold a lot of books doing that, so props to him honestly.
I made thousands on upstart’s bull run
I just sold my sofi for 25% profit on the onset of the downgrades.  Sofi is a great trading stock. Buy it on beatdowns prior to earnings, sell soon after earnings. Of course I was way in the hole at first because I bought into the spac hype.
I opened up verticals, and potentially will open up short positions. The premiums of puts are too expensive.
TSM is already the 10th biggest company and up 36% this year, it’s not a hidden gem.
Imo, Intel is the overlooked value atm. They are currently bringing their TSMC 5nm equivalent process online and appear to be successfully executing their roadmap to better it by '25. They recently posted a pb quarterly loss and are sitting around half their ath.
Building the shovel isn’t as profitable as selling the designs for the shovel
I mean Google developed TPUs (Tensor Processing Units) and already uses them, although I don't know how widely.
>Pretty sure Google and Meta at least have developed their own AI processors and are planning to start producing them "soon".  Oh yeah and for sure the fund managers that move the markets missed that but savvy redditurs know this little secret that will make them rich!
I know nothing about AI or tech stocks but that’s what I’m doing
I highly doubt it.  "This is the year of linux desktops!"  Open source is great, but for years and years and years it required (and still does) ungodly amounts of support.  AI is even newer and requires even more specialty knowledge.  Nobody is giving up their Golden Goose if they have a rockstar AI dev team, and no AI developer is going to be doing it for pennies when they'll be thrown bags of money.  Just look at "Open"AI.  Their mission to preserve and promote openness for AI models lasted basically no time at all once their realized they could make bank.  Then: "The organization stated it would "freely collaborate" with other institutions and researchers by making its patents and research open to the public."  Now: "ChatGPT owner OpenAI projects $1 billion in revenue by 2024"
The only way I can see that happening is if Intel really pushes it.  AMD was too late to the game with openCL, so all the software that needed GPU compute was already targeting cuda.  Their GPU division has never been good with targeting enterprise customers either, hence why everything still only targets cuda.  Intel has a much better track record of working with other companies to help push adoption (just ignore Itanium), so maybe they'll be able to get enough support for openCL that enterprise customers will consider non nvidia hardware.
I don't think you been here long welcome to wsb lol by far the most entertaining group on the net. wait till the jpow ai voice overs come out again those are gold. Lol
oh yeah post a high quality analysis which we all come here for
I’d love some quality TA. What ya got?
Given how much money this sub losses on premiums, 69s is a better name.
Meta is literally digging its own grave... Can you imagine Facebook/the metaverse full of spambots trying to sell you their shitcoins... ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)  R.I.P. facebook/meta and other social media... people will leave that shit and have a real life again.
Uhm. Over 200x
Doesn’t matter when the speculation is GROWTH related, actual zombie. It can be over or undervalued based on what WILL happen not what is happening
Ehh... maybe back to $240.  But the problem is it will probably hit $515 before it hits $240.  Personally, it's in a No-Man's-Land right now. I'm holding some shares, but I wouldn't buy/sell or short
TSMC and ASML
You mean, who manufactures the shovels? Nvidia, in this case.  Who manufactures the components to the shovels? Access denied! We don't want to break capitalism, after all.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)
🤡🫵🤡😂😂
Lol 450+ after next earnings call
Pretty sure those chips are being made somewhere else. Samsung makes the tensor G2, I think tsm makes em for apple.
FSELX
Everything will have an nvidia chip in it despite nvidia not making chips? Bold prediction.
> almost every one will own something with a NVDA chip in it.  I doubt it.  Large cloud providers are the ones gobbling up chips and paying $$$ for them.  There's still little-to-no capacity for consumer chips.
Sell covered calls then ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260)
… up the rear
ELI5: GPU can do more work at the same time. But the type of tasks it can do is “limited”. The machine learning algorithms match the kind of workload a GPU is good at.
AI models are roughly speaking a set of millions of simple mathematical operations. GPUs can run those operations in parallel cause they have many small cpus inside, while a regular CPUs are better at handling few heavier tasks.
Awhile ago GPU companies pivoted because gamers no longer needed high end graphics cards. Their GPU architecture was useful for doing specific fast math processes. Software developers leveraged this and more recently this hardware was used for crypto mining before getting replaced by ASICS that churned every year as better ASIC miners came out  There is a bet that GPU Makers will have a similar turn over in Hardware As crypto miners did with a ASICs  GPU is now a misnomer. When PlayStation 3 came it with parallel processing decades ago it was a GPUs. And many PlayStations because they were sold less than how much they took to manufacture at the time (lock retail into their game line up) researchers and developers bought a bunch of them as cheap fast computing power. PlayStation basically accidentally subsidized science instead of video game addiction like they were originally hoping. And all the competent developers for this processor moved or chose to research or serious application programming as they paid more than video games for the same architecture  AI is heavily tied to data marketing and ads. We are computing many many many simple things over rate datasets. AI is a robust way of making sense of that data. And you'll be surprised to know that the rules for chat GPT are extremely simple and just needs lots of data and simple but massive compute  time. The hardware itself isn't doing the thinking. It's more of the data processing and making a prediction algo using that data that makes current AI powerful.   Instead of one big CPU you take a ton of little processors threading a bunch of small tasks. Even CPUs basically just added more threads to gain power. GPUs just go heavy on threads count. So # of tiny processes can be started on since threads are available and released after process is done.   A highway can fit more people over it if they all rode bikes just slower than cars. Idk what a bus is in this analogy so don't ask. I don't think that exists yet but would be extremely efficient for seats per sqft/sqm calls on the company if anyone knows why say it would be

![img](emote|t5_2th52|4259)
Nvda directors pocketed it
It won't burst, it will be waves of AI hype every 5 to 7 years ( no idea if this is true or not, just a random guess).
You people do realize most of the profit is closer to the endconsumer right?  The futher down the line you go in the supply chain. The less the margins are.  Or do you think those miners selling raw material are the biggest companies on earth?
I mean, ASML is selling shovels to TSMC
Until you realized that ASML is the real shovel store not TSMC.
ASML is the real shovel. TSMC is fuck all without ASML.  But NVIDIA just gets the lowest price from TSMC due to their scale. And then they sell their products with nice juicy margins
Ive been dcaing that stock for the last since i turned 18
Maybe for AMD. Not the case for everything nvidia makes.
[deleted]
No, TSMC has too much capacity they can't sell and NVDA is the only buyer in town. In this analogy they're more like the steel mill.
The sell to Apple, AMD, Nvidia and Intel just to name a few big companies. (There are plenty more.)
INTC ![img](emote|t5_2th52|27189)
Nope it's ASML
I think he means Market Makers. He is saying that you will be buying those calls at high premiums, and therefore you need a large move to make a profit.
I’m guessing the likes of AMAT, LRCX, ASML, TSMC…upstream of NVDA…the ones actually making the chips, and the machines that make the chips, and the machines that make the machines that make the chips.
[removed]
Market makers/Algos
🫠 are you kidding lol
Most definitely. As long as your basis isn’t $435 lol.
Next time a bill collector calls, just tell them there is no one named bill there available for them to collect
A price war with a couple other large companies, and like half a dozen well-funded startups.  But also an actual trade war between your home country and your second largest end market, specifically targeting the one thing that brings in more than half of your revenue.
>And you are about to enter a trade war with at least two bigger companies.  It took 10 years for AMD to catch up with Intel and Intel is an idiot, I think as long as Jensen is the CEO they're not gonna fall behind.
That's not what PE is...
Catching a falling wife
Note to those behind the Wendy's dumpsters, sell your pants
If you posted this at 500B and said 1T you be have been downvoted just as much.  NVDA is a once in a lifetime opportunity
Literally every single piece of electronics has or will have chips. All the jobs that will be lost to AI will be lost to chips. NVIDIA and Taiwan Semiconductors and AMD makes those chips.  Just think of it this way...for a long time, all cars and ships and trains and planes ran off some form of oil.  CHIPS are OIL.
I believe. Can one down voter name a competitor with anything like NVIDIAs like AI stuff, the jetson family, graphics cards? Find another NVIDIA isn't like shopping for another cereal brand
If you’re bullish I’m selling
This sub would say: “your mom is too expensive“
Premium on puts are pretty cheap for mid to long dated ones
If everyone's theory proves correct in 10 years, and chip demand is still sky high with tech and AI then the only real under dog play at the moment is Intel.
I think NVDA is up around 36% just since earnings in late May.  If TSM guidance is positive on earnings call in a couple of weeks, I think it still has room to go.
It's still a gamble.   Their culture is horrendous and AMD is eating their lunch.
IIRC they mainly use those for internal stuff, but still buy loads of nvidia products for GCP.
Yeah you right, funds never go belly up
When you are done sucking hedge fund dick, maybe we can go back to talking about gambling at the casino?
Even if A.I. fails, AMD will make money from data centers and embedded. I like the stock. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)
Just like your trades, the opposite is true in this scenario.

Give all my hard work away for free. It sounds crazy but our smartest college kids do that every year to get corporate experience. May as well post it on here for the apes to hurt themselves with.
Lol, $515? And can I ask what catalyst do you think will catapult it to that level?
I missed the "meme"
RemindMe! 2 months
RemindMe! 2 months
But they’re not Nvidia! Which was kind of my point. Nvidia is probably king for the everyday retail AI enthusiast. But the other big companies probably won’t need them.
TSMC (maybe Samsung if TSMC didn't have enough capacity this gen, idk) makes them for nvidia too, you're confusing design vs manufacturing here.
SMH
NVIDIA captures most of the margin within the supply chain though, especially for enterprise. $100 chip and sell it for $1000, easy money
LMFAO..... GM doesn't make every part for its cars. Neither does Tesla. Apple doesnt make every part of it's computers and phones.....TSMC may physically manufacture the chips for NVDA, but that doesn't mean it still isn't a NVDA chip. They design them after all.  Outsourcing of manufacturing happens in every industry. I just got some pans, for instance, from MadeIn Cookware. They don't make it themselves: they contract with a place in Tennessee to make it. So, is my pan not a MadeIn pan then?
for now  Every game changing technology started out extremely expensive and was only owned by large companies, governments, universities, etc.  Look at computers: it used to be that they were so expensive and large that no consumer had them. Now, they are everywhere.  Cell phones: The first one cost 10,000 in todays money. Now, a basic one can be had for $100 or so.  Consumer demand for these AI chips will be here, eventually. AI is the next PC, the next cell phone. We don't yet know it's capability, just like the inventors of the computer or cell phone had no idea what they would turn into
:)
We’ve had AI for years it’s hype currently due to ChatGPT and midjourney.  I would like to add that AMD has more powerful hardware than Nvidia but they are launching behind Nvidia and the software may not be as user friendly as Nvidia’s. (Hyper scalers won’t care though, they just need what’s the most powerful/power efficient.)
Like oil companies?

The software companies are technically closer to the end consumer, so this statement doesn't jive with the comic
Oh yeah, TSMC makes small gross margins of 50%+ and small operating margins of 40%+. Super small ey.
You do realize NVIDIA is not the only store in town and many of the big companies are start making their own chip. But guess who is the only one that can make the most advanced chip ![img](emote|t5_2th52|31249)
> You people do realize most of the profit is closer to the endconsumer right?  Tell that to the stores selling the GPUs and the board partners making them.
*Checks TSMC's net profit margin*  45%
Did you check the margins of ASML? Operating profit margin > 30%.  Margins depend on many factors. Competition and replaceability js one of them.
[deleted]
Wouldn’t that imply the profits are higher at Google, Meta, and Microsoft because they’re closer to the end consumer than Nvidia?  I mean… they are, but sell shovels to people digging for gold, as a statement, is literally implying the opposite; by selling something that people closest to the consumer absolutely need to provide that thing to the consumer, you can possibly do better than the people actually providing the thing (gold) to the consumer (boomer).
Nornickel has higher profit margin than Google, try again
What do you mean by YOU PEOPLE?!
You people do realize that most of the profit came from finding gold right? Why bother selling shovels when you are guaranteed to find gold?
LOL TSMCs gross margin is like 60% and net over 40% what are you talking about
Like airlines ?
Its selling the machines that make shovels...
Nah the miners are the end consumer, Nvidia is the shovel store, TSMC makes the parts for the shovel, ASML provides the tools to make the parts
nope... They are the only one who *currently* have the best suited product for it.  But it just has begun... A lot can change rather quickly.
TSMC and alike don't make the machines to produce the dies. Other companies do, check news on Netherlands and other European countries joining the USA bann on Chinese chips. It's important bc. companies from those countries make the machines for the lines for TSMC which makes the chips for NVIDIA. Making modern microchips with nanometers of precision is so complex that is hards grasp and no single, not even two or 3 company alone holds enough knowhow to produce than.
Suppliers don't typically make much profit in these situations. The further upstream you go the smaller the profits.  The thing people are not understanding is NVDA ML chips are not high volume items, they're low volume chips marked up 500% by NVDA. Suppliers benefit when there is high volume - such as during covid when everyone is buying a new PC and cryptominers were buying GPUs by the planeload. Suppliers don't benefit when PC sales are down.
The real liquid gold here is cornering the sand market. All those chips have to be made from something!
Thank you very much 👍

$10T market cap isn’t a meme  Nvidia will dominate the earth
Have you checked out IONQ? It's a pretty solid company. As of right now my office (we are an investment advisory firm) have about 10% of our personal retirement account in long term calls on the company.
Lol, AMD and NVidea don't make chips. Intel and TSMC do.
Remind me again, how many fabs does NVIDIA own…?  Zero? Aw shit, there goes your theory.
The CHIPS are my CORN! These chips are how I buy my house. They keep my house hot!
Smart man
This. Their stock is dirt cheap atm and the main reason for that was that they had issues with their last 2 iterations of their own litography fabs; they appear to have sorted it out with their upcoming process, with TSMC basically maxed out with all their current production capacity (much of their newest node going to Apple) they are the only company with free up to speed tech production capacity. I like'em. :3
Short of nuclear war, how would the demand for chips not keep going up?
Is there any reason to believe that they will produce competitive GPUs in the following years?
They have recently started to offer GPUs/accelerators as well again. Maybe it's going to pan out better than xeon phi did. Although benchmarks are quite underwhelming so far for AI workloads.   Also they have been a value trap for so long that I hardly see anyone getting overlay excited about their stock anytime soon.
Im also a hodling hype chasing regard, so do with that what you will.
The Pixel phones use them
What catapult pulled it to 444 from 400?
irrational exuberance. People wanting to Fomo into the AI shovel seller. I'm going to hop off the train at $485. If it doesn't get to $485, then it will be a bad decision on my part. But I see my $485 exit before I see $240.

Yeah the Nvidia stans constantly talking like every single company ever is going to need their shit.
For sure, but you said 5 years.  None of that is happening in 5 years.  Big companies like AAPL, MSFT, NVDA already have 5 years worth of product mapped out.  The Apple Vision Pro was in development for 6-8 years before it was launched.  TSMC likely already has fab capacity booked out for the next 2-4 years.
We are certainly not talking about these nations that are wealthy only because of oil right?   /s
Futbol
Regards
I mean the software companies can print SaaS shovels
There is a lot of competition. No one is denying this. But this is basic things you learn in intro econ courses. You can't just go back in the supply chain and say "hey those guys are making the real profit". Because most of the time they are not. For example TSMC is still heavily reliant on ASML and their machines. Tell me, is ASML the biggest company on earth?  Idk even know what this sub even is anymore. These comments sound like shit boomers say.
Google is the only big company with its own TPU and they're about 3 years behind NVDA. AMD and Intel are nowhere, all the other TPU projects are likely to be behind Google.   For the next 2-3 years NVDA is the only viable offering for anyone except Google and maybe MSFT.
Micron, MU
Everyone wants to, but no one is even close. NVDA has been working on this under the radar for the past 20 years. Their GPU chips funded the entire operation, including using gaming and mining as R&D during the crypto boom.   Their GPU chips were the tip of the iceberg. There's a lot more beneath that no one even knows about.
Yes investing in MSFT will make you more money than losing all of your money on Nikola and all other shit stocks bots push in this sub.
But :  How many shovel stores are there?  How many shovels brands are there?  How many miners are there?  How many designers are there?  How many shovel factories are there?  Who wil have the best shovel in the foreseable future?  &#x200B;  That is the real question...

Right, those would be the others I listed. ASML is the Dutch company you’re thinking of. They are all upstream of Nvidia, but there are levels. ASML, AMAT etc are further upstream of TSMC.  Edit, mixed up by Dutches and Danishes, thank you kid sir
Partly agree. I think it’s more about the difficulty and rarity of the task in the value chain. Which is why an ASML is richly valued. Nobody else can do their thing, and TSMC needs it, hence NVDA needs it. Whomever owns the chokepoint owns the value.
Damn dude you should get off Reddit and be an entrepreneur, you got a business idea where you sell at 100% gross margin. VC will love that shit
Fail a dying wife
You are still thinking small.  Nvidia will monopolize the hardware market for all electronic devices. Then they will use this position to take over all software companies.  After that they will move into raw resources and production of all other products.  The next step will be to defeat all governments on Earth 1 by 1 until they control the whole world and enslave all of humanity, animals, plants, fungi, bacteria and Protista.  Then they move into space and conquer worlds 1 by 1 until they control the entire galactic empire with a moon sized space laser base capable of destroying entire planets with a single shot if they dare to resist. A serious argument could be made for $2T per share.  Powering the machines with AI that Midjourney uses to make pictures of a fat Spider-Man is just step 2 of their 4 step business plan.
100%
 NVidia designs them, which is arguably a better business to be in than manufacturing.
Look at the market cap of TSMC and INTC. Not a great business to be in.
This is correct--by "make" I meant "utilize" or "have significant relationships with the manufacturers."

Hey those ASML machines need Carl Zeiss parts.
or really regarded folks. Like certified regarded.
>Tell me, is ASML the biggest company on earth?  Oh, you mean the largest tech company in Europe by like a factor of two.   The thing about econ rules is that they're descriptive not prescriptive. They're largely made up based on observed patterns and there's always exceptions to the patterns.
How many customers does ASML has vs TSMC? You are comparing apple to orange here. Do better
> For the next 2-3 years NVDA is the only viable offering for anyone except Google and maybe MSFT.  Oh yeah, that must mean you need to pay a 100x multiple on profit for it today. Because the next 2-3 years will be a fantastic indicator for the 97 years to come after that before you earn back your money.
Intel is going to sky rocket the fuck up next year. Imagine a world where they could have a 12 month buffer with the latest and greatest lithography machines starting next year. I wonder how much difference that would make...
yeah very convincing /sarcasm.  My best friend actually teaches artificial intelligence at the local university. :)  Nvidia is \*currently\* the best choice... but better technology exists and is being worked on by many.  The race only just begun.  Big hint: intel has been doing AI research for decades ;)

TSMC is the tenth most valuable company in the world despite priced in heavy geopolitical risk. How is it not a great business to be in?
I knew it was a matter of time before someone brought up ole Carl
My local bakery has more customers than ASML. What is your point?
I’ve had this same logic and that’s why I’ve made no money in stocks. Apparently value investing isn’t a thing in the past 5 years
Do you understand how growth works? PE ratio of Facebook was around 70 when it IPOed, bad investment?  You also seem strangely allergic to profit in a sub about short term trading profits. Who cares about after 3 years? I'm not marrying the stock.
There's only one thing sure in this world that in 100 years Intel will be the same shit company it has been for the last 20 years sitting at the same shit share price of $20-$40, good luck with that shit.
That's been Intel for the last decade+ and nothing substantial has materialized
The second Intel becomes an anchor for Arm when they IPO it’s going to climb. The IPO is supposed to happen by the end of the year. Intel is in the dip but not for long
These kids dont understand what intel is... all they know is their favourite youtube/tik-tok influencer spamming AMD hype and acting as if ntel is the one copying AMD... they have no clue at all.

“Geopolitical risk” exactly.   The real technology is in ASML EUV or the finished product.
And i lost shit ton shorting
I bet you use the "Market is forward looking" argument while using mega short term trends to explain stock movement, too?  I never said I'm against short term profits. I just think it's dumb as fuck to mix and match arguments to suit your view.  Also, picking one specific stock after the fact is not really proving any point. I bet I can pick 10 stocks with a PE ratio of 70 (or higher) at IPO that's been dogshit.
For the last decade, they were stuck on 14nm +++++++.
Even in terms of graphics cards, intel now has legit mid range contenders at a cheaper price point, and they will have access to the next gen of lithography tech for about 12 full months next year. It'll be a good year for them
Any portion of any 5%. Checks out
Given.
Handy?
You're acting like TSMC doesn't have a huge technological moat in their fabs as compared to for example Intel.
Right, so p/e is meaningless, isn’t it?
>I bet you use the "Market is forward looking" argument while using mega short term trends to explain stock movement, too?  Why did NVDA pop after ER if that's not the case?  >I never said I'm against short term profits. I just think it's dumb as fuck to mix and match arguments to suit your view.  You're clearly against short term profits. Somehow 2-3 years of absolute dominance in a quickly growing industry isn't enough for you. You decided to speculate about 30 years from now.  A quick search of your profile shows you're a permabear who was short tech into this gigantic rally and short NVDA before ER. How's that going for you? How's your 2020 and 2021 shorts going?  [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/search/?q=author%3Alaetus&restrict\_sr=1&type=comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/search/?q=author%3Alaetus&restrict_sr=1&type=comment)  Typical permabear who went to 0 years ago and now just spends all their time proselytizing their worldview. I'd as for a pnl history, but it's obvious you haven't traded in at least 5 years.  >Also, picking one specific stock after the fact is not really proving any point. I bet I can pick 10 stocks with a PE ratio of 70 (or higher) at IPO that's been dogshit.  That's nice? Except your literal entire argument is "NVDA price must fall because it's at 100 PE", that's it, nothing else.  EDIT: Lol nice block, typical permabear.
Which is resolved now that the shit managment has been sent to wendies.
The topic is ML. Arc chips are nearly worthless at gen AI tasks. A770 has about a third the performance of a 3060 at gen AI and they have zero community support.
If that's your takeaway there is no point in talking to you.
 ok dude. It's called a hype bubble. hope it goes well for you.
Well I agree that Pat Gelsinger is a better fit for the job since he is an engineer leading some of the brightest engineers I am worried about Intel’s financial bottom line since they are losing server market share to AMD and Intel is axing technologies to keep their core business alive. (They killed Optane/3D Xpoint memory and cutdown their networking division. Their latest venture into dedicated graphics is even being called into question if it will fade away in the coming years.)  Now I can see the foundry business being profitable in the coming years once that’s actually spun up and they have electronic designs/IP to manufacture products but that also requires businesses to choose them. (A company with little experience manufacturing for others and with more expensive process nodes in comparison to TSMC equivalents.)
We'll see...  Intel has better raytracing too, especially now with their new paper about using neuro accelleration and caching...  Also look up: Intel neuromorphic computing, intel gaudi (and the updates comming), Intel Loihi, Intel photonics, and their quantum computing chips....
Their upcooming products are going to retake the crown from AMD, even AMD fans agree with that (that understand the upcomming tech).  Them opening up their fabs is also going to give a big financial boost, escpecially with governemnts as clients and getting orders for the defence departments in times of war.  Their fabs are also on the way to pass TSMC again.
Buzzwords does not equate actual products. Intel literally admitted they're far behind AMD/NVDA even on XPU by announcing they won't be releasing a product till 2025.
Intel is leaning into accelerators on die and a tile design for future products yes, however AMD has been using chiplets already and is expanding their accelerator designs as well. (yes I know chiplets and tiles have specific design considerations differences namely cost and performance of the packaging technology.)  Keep in mind Intel does have interesting technologies coming but that doesn’t mean AMD isn’t also making interesting products as well. (They are pretty evenly matched in my opinion, I like products that compete off technical design differences and not from stagnation of one company.)  My concerns with Intel are also that recently Intel hasn’t been able to execute on timelines, many of their recent products have slipped past the times that they promised to customers. (Giving AMD an advantage “to be ahead” since Intel can stick to a timeline.)  I know I’ve been negative on intel here but that’s because I expect better from them, they had a monopoly on CPU’s while AMD was going bankrupt and Intel stopped pushing as hard on technical design wins. This opened the window for AMD’s Ryzen, Threadripper and EPYC families to be competitive and dig AMD out of near bankruptcy and back into the black. Intel has some amazing technologies but man do they like shooting themselves in the foot with their execution. (Optane being a big one: it promised latency of RAM but the capacity of NAND and it has unheard of drive life but suffered from poor adoption from customers due to price.)
Ok, so i get you dont even bother to look it up..  These are actual existing products :)
Tiles are better than chiplets... specifically in terms of power usage and latency...  Also, the issues that caused the delays have been adressed and fixed.  There was an opportunity to invest in AMD when intel was into trouble... Now the opportunity is to invest in the beaten down intel and sell the pumped up AMD...
Even worse, actual existing products nobody buys and has nothing to do with the topic - gen AI chips.
I’m invested in both. (Not Nvidia though since it’s been hyped for years and it doubled when it talked about AI this year and that was my double down point on not buying in.)
You really have no clue..  By the way, intel has already hinted they will beat their ER projection.
Wow what a rebuttal, very convincing. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)  >By the way, intel has already hinted they will beat their ER projection.   The ones that were in the toilet? ![img](emote|t5_2th52|18630)
Great discussion
Positions or ban and also this isn’t your Twitter account
[deleted]
Yeah? Tell me how it works.
I’m shorting nvda. Avg price: $423.
We can laugh about Cramer but his biggest call was Nvidia and it landed big
19% of my portfolio is in NVDA and I got in at an average cost basis of $174.  I'm not mad (maybe stupid for holding, but not mad... yet)
Being the owner of an overpriced NVDA gpu, I can't help but feel proud knowing my purchase contributed to this ridiculous evaluation. I'd swing trade it but knowing me I'd sleep through the few minutes that my options are wildly profitable one day.
I’m all in $30k for 7/21 $400p. Bought em Friday.
NVDA 800?
NVIDIA will crash on Monday
Why did you not post this in february, why bre
how did you program it and how do you collate the news? I want to guess it is pandas-related and something in python to scrap the web for news.
Where did you find that chart?
Def sketch af.   Rigged is the best word.  Like shooting a basketball thru a 6” diameter rim
pump n dump
I not so long ago slightly less than a hundred shares ... now .... im looking on ebay for gtx 1080 ti that's 200 bucks too expensive for me..  These swings godddamnit
 What gif with news make next?
I sold all mine, got in when NVIDIAs market cap was $60bn, talked a lot of friends and family into buying stock too and everyone has sold now. Book value $9.92 is too hard to overlook, AI will be incredible but we are incredibly early
Stock skyrockets, so they talk about it. Duh.
algorhytm :)
algos know gud ai when they see it
One of the very, very few Cramer got right. He was on this for years when everyone wasn't.
📉
I sold 1/3 rd of my nvda position. All of the corporate brass took profits so why not. It almost paid for my podition, andvI'll let the rest ride.
Has nvidia stock in my RRSP, made 8k cad, you guys are scaring me. :|
Ok but what will it do next?
Short Apple while your at it. 😂
I’m shorting too when it hits $690
How broke will you be when it hits $500?
I will add more shorts if NVDA goes to $470
He went short Nvidia in November at $130 and called it a loser too
He also said it was a sell and to stay away when it was down big. So screw him and all of the other talking heads that had dire warnings about how much worse it was going to get for nvda's stock price. Warnings that correlated with the exact best time to buy.
I had around 400 shares at 130$ average. I exited at 430$  But I think I'll buy back once it drops below 300-350 again. The stock is cyclic so Im pretty sure it will touch 300 in nwar future.
This isn't financial advice, but if you take profit, not completely closing position, it lowers your average cost.  For instance, if you sold half your shares at the current stock price, you would not only have more money than you bought the shares for, but you also lower your average cost basis to 121.55.
I forgot about nvidia earnings don’t even start.
Definitely to $500 by eoy. Probably on next earnings report, then they’ll draw down and probably chop until Q4 and return to $500 during the Santa rally
   Lol
Because the chart starts at March?
DIS?
tsla xom crm spce oxy aapl
So what colour lambo did you buy?
Nah, Apple still has a forward P/E under 30.  We may be stupid, but we have methods.
I asked Chatgpt what it thought of me buying puts on nvidia and it said it could not give me advice.  I asked Siri on my iphone 6s if I should buy puts on Apple and she said I should ask my ex Blackberry how those Calls had been going....    Ai is my financial advisor now.
I will be down like 10to 20k ish
i will  add more shorts when NVDA goes up from 500
It was such an abrupt shift from his usual stance for Nvidia. If anything he was lying and buying calls because I’m sure he gets some good inside info from Jensen considering how much he’s sucked his dick in the past.   I look at stock analysts like I do about fantasy football ones. You gotta read between the lines sometimes and realize that they don’t want EVERYBODY to see the big time studs that are gonna blow up. They also tend to give safe picks or hot takes. It’s up to you to decipher their tone or enthusiasm and decide are they saying this because they really believe it or it’s just some BS their producers are pushing them to say.   Last year we were in the midst of a major correction so it was a good tip to be cautious generally speaking and one way for him to convey that was to appear bearish on a company like Nvidia. He named his damn dog after it and by going bearish on them it was in essence advising retail investors to watch out about the market trending down.   The thing about Nvidia and Cramer is that he was so gung-ho about their importance in autonomous driving. I think that’s ridiculous. Autonomous driving should NOT become a thing unless the vehicle is on its own independent lane. I’m confused why they haven’t made autonomous airplanes, trains or boats a major topic of innovation before going straight to cars because of everyday driving seems way more random than everything else. Nvidia is gonna kill it in the AR and VR world. They already rule the graphics card market in the flat form and have been for 20+ years. In my opinion gaming graphics has nearly maxed out in 2D.
Nice little 120k gain
I agree, it will dip before further move
Why not short when leg down begins?
Why do you think it would go down??
I fell into the trap from value investors that this could be another Cisco and sold 30% last year.
How do you come up with this theory and this specific figure?
Dumb ass - you appear to be trying to describe tax lot selling. That said, the lower cost basis only happens if the lots you sell have the higher cost basis (so less profit to take). Either way you are an idiot
No.

Wow, you still have a 6s? I'm impressed lol
Thank you for your sacrifice
Any negative news and it'll drop. But biggest drop will be if they miss EPS (I dont think they'll miss though). I don't know the exact reason because Im a regard but based on past data, the stock is cyclic and has +-100$ swings every year.

I imagine they will beat guidance handily for qtr ending 7/31.  No way they raised expectations and won’t beat it.    If Jensen raises again for the next couple quarters all hell will break loose.

I mean if you bought in batches and selling some can change your cost average, as it will consider only remaining batches, but stating a specific figure makes no sense.
🤣🤣
If you buy  $100k of stock at $15.00, and $100k at $10.00, your cost basis is $12.50, if you sell half, it won't reduce your cost basis.  Unless I'm missing some kind of WSB crayon math logic
If you buy 1 share for 15 and 1 share for 10 your average cost basis is 12,5. If you sell one share usually the shares bought first will be sold first. In our example the share bought for 10 will remain and your broker will display 10 as average cost basis of remaining shares.
Kind of them to let us in on this.
how deep though
In a normal market economy sure, but we’ve already seen the government is not willing to let the market correct in the light banking crisis earlier this year. If the government continues to save the first dominoes that topple to prevent the chain reaction then how are we expecting a hard landing? Something big has to fail to set everything else off and JPow is willing yo spend unlimited monies to prevent that.
A kind reminder that Carvana has 6.5 Billion in debt![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
You mean the recession that’s been coming for what? 3 years now??
I totally believe these fund managers. They have my best interest.
Nobody has lost their job predicting a recession.  They just fire their whole team and get back a few years back.
I've been hearing about a crash for years now- an upcoming recession, and market crash. But we just got out of a 20% SPY drop, and I keep hearing about the monied classes hoarding cash for the dip. How low would this dip have to be if they haven't used it yet?
Except central banks have provided liquidity at every moment they’ve been called on. They don’t give a fuck about inflation. So stonks go up baby
Delusional. From people who want 0% interest loans back.
So buy bonds or not?
My PHK has definitely had a hard landing already.
Fund managers shouting 'Recession!' is just the Ying to companies shouting 'AI!' Yang
All this harder and tightening talk is getting me excited.
Yes
I want it hard and deep
To save the last dominoes they had to print more, which reverted some of the QT. There's no way out
This article is talking about the world economy.  It's entirely possible for the US to have a soft recession with the rest of the world falling much harder. Especially with China and Russia in a tailspin and oil demand falling off of a cliff, this seems likely.
Only if the catalyst happens outside usa
People who are saying “unlimited monies to print” have you considered that’s exactly why we have inflation? can you imagine your $100 bill being completely worthless? that’s what you’re talking about.   so please consider:  	1.	Overlooking risks: The theory focuses on the positive aspects of expanding global liquidity but fails to address the potential risks associated with excessive liquidity. It doesn’t consider the possibility of inflationary pressures or the impact on asset bubbles.  	2.	Assumption of perpetual central bank support: The theory assumes that central banks will continue injecting substantial cash into money markets and bailing out governments indefinitely. However, central banks may face constraints or reach limits on their ability to provide unlimited liquidity.  	3.	Neglecting fiscal challenges: While the theory acknowledges the need for fiscal stability, it downplays the challenges faced by governments with excessive debt burdens. It doesn’t explore potential consequences of governments relying heavily on central bank support and accumulating even higher levels of debt.  	4.	Lack of consideration for interest rate dynamics: The theory doesn’t account for the potential impact of rising interest rates on bond markets and the ability of households and pension funds to absorb higher borrowing costs. Higher rates could lead to increased fiscal deficits, creating a compounding problem.
Now that retirements are based on stock market with basically no pensions for people and a goal of returning to free money rates that punish savers - how can the govt ever afford to let the market crash. Really sucks.
VM spitting facts.
Ok so I get it - they’re trying to make a profit and have previously shown they will lie to retail to sell their bags or buy before a run up.    But consider the actual psychology behind what your saying at this specific time:  We’re currently at session highs and nearing ATHs for major indices.  The average person already feels there are numerous factors that *should* drive prices down.  We’ve been told for months that a recession is imminent.  **We’re already in an environment where the average investor is resistant to buy and is likely taking a little bit of profit off the table**   What reason would they have to pump a false narrative about looming recessions, **now**?   Everyone is already waiting for it.  No one is buying.  Wealthy individuals are already moving money out of stocks and into more stable ventures.    “Inverse the assholes” only works if a) they aren’t well aware that you know to inverse them, and b) you know when to inverse them and when to believe them.    Liars lie, even when they tell the truth.
we are going into a growth recession at best. this is expected by latest Q1 2024. the markets have risen lately due to a misguided doubt in the federal reserves hawkishness, FOMO and Artificial Intelligence hype.   The truth is that already previously revised (lower) revisions have lead us into the earnings recession we are currently in. credit conditions and monetary policy is tightening and restrictive. and the fed is definitely not bluffing.   we are already seeing slower growth from the leading economic indicators and we are reaching the end of the cycle.
they guy above said there will be growth recession.  So to answer your question: you should buy not bods
The would is largely tied to the US though and especially true in the case of China. A soft landing means US consumers continue to travel to Europe spending USD and they continue buying trash on amazon made in China. Both of those actions will keep dollars circulating in the major economies outside the U.S. so I really don’t see how the US is soft and everywhere else is hard. The opposite is certainly true - the US is hard and drags everyone else down too.
Credit Suisse happened and UBS swallowed it.
Have I? Yes I have. Does that mean the fed will stop? No. Clearly Powell is more concerned with his soft landing than actually breaking inflation. He has been far to light with his rate hikes lately and the most recent pause is absolutely ridiculous when you look at the cost of living, the real cost with rents factored in, and the reality of wages not growing to meet this out of control explosion of cost. Sure milk and eggs may be stabilizing but the bulk of where consumers spend their money is on housing and this bucket is at record highs.   The main issue here is that this is a lagging indicator with about 12 months between start to seeing it in the CPI. 12 months ago we were just starting the rate hikes and now we’ve stopped? All of the insane rent increases that have happened since July 2022 are just now going to start landing in the index for the Fed to see and then they’ll realize holy crap actually inflation is still raging.   But they don’t care. It’s about the stock market for them now.
What do you think the money in pensions are allocated in? Cash? Lmao
He's being sarcastic
They're selling puts and killing the buyers.  Literally the game plan the last six months.  If you look at weak industries the put to call ratio is insane.  A market dip would wreck the market just through options.
what is a growth recession? How would earnings drop when unemployment is at a record low? Oil is way down from a year ago, supply crunches have smoothed out, the economy has been doing better than anyone expected. I am not seeing on what basis a recession would come in - unless we raise rates so high that we bring one into existence. Putting all of inflation on wage increases, when they have been depressed for 30-35 years for most people, seems like choosing the softest target. Below 50k/year people making more means they spend more, means more profits, and they are the largest group. what am I missing?
Exactly. World reserve currency to the rescue.
To be fair, it's more like UBS were strapped to a chair as Swiss government jammed CS down their throat while whispering the incentives and guarantee they would get if they be a good dog and swallow it.
I should call her
Yup, this is why JPow keeps giving confusing ass statements.  We know inflation is high, we're pausing hikes, we know inflation is hurting the poors, we're hiking every other meeting, we're data dependent and inflation hasn't improved enough, so we're pausing.    There will be no landing for the market.  There will be a landing squarely on the nutsacks of the poor.
But people are *already buying puts*.  Most people are already bearish on things, and can see the “extreme greed” indicator.    So why the hell would they need to pump out some fake statement about looming recession, now?
Bing bong
Which will happen basically anywhere in the eurozone or UK so I don’t see a scenario other than China somehow collapsing that would cause the crisis these hedge fund managers are predicting. Hell even with China they had a huge housing collapse with Evergrande and what happened? The government absorbed it and it was little more than a blip on the radar.
Public Investment Fund had a 10% rule of not owning anything more than that. Wise. So when CS was saying buy more, PIF said no with that info, and the stock dropped 25% that day. Than CS was known to be in bad shape.
Mmmmmmm, sounds like the making of some good Suisse Foie Gras
The top isn't when the big boys are telling you it's overpriced. It's when they tell you it's gonna run more.
They didn’t even mention AI once n that report.  I call fake news propaganda lies.
Screw the reports. This is why you follow the charts, not the analyst reports or talking heads. Half the time they are positioning themselves on the opposite side of the trade creating a market to either buy or sell. As the old saying goes, actions speak louder than words. Looks like good ole chuck Schwab owns over 13 mil share of NVDA as of 3/31. If they are still holding today it would be their third largest holding by position size.
Here is a better idea short Charles Schwab
NVDA to 500 EOY got it!
They also said to sell back in October...
Bought PUTS Friday, this is way overpriced  Not a Bad stock but this price is no no
facts. add on top of that it’s a cyclical stock in a slowing economy.  https://preview.redd.it/gfrdw218tl9b1.jpeg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a12ffec09bf465d77065207d98aa9d735ab946ce
Calls on NVDA got it.
In weeks we could see a bear market cause the fear and greed index is extreme greedy. Buffett once said that (be) “fearful when others are greedy and be greedy when others are fearful
Bro you're not supposed to share these... Chase gives me the same thing and it says it's only for me... They're going to get you!!!
Betting against America? My condolences. I’m sorry for your future.
That kind of bear?
lmao you belong here dummy
That’s why you and schwab continue to lose $$
It doesn’t cost a nickel to “ Rate” someone
300p 03/14/24
Are you taking any pupils for your school of thought ?
Call put ratio means it ?
Shhhhhhhh don’t tell everyone
AI is just another market bubble that will subside eventually. Just like all the rest. There is way too much damn money in just 7 companies and eventually people will take it out and put it elsewhere. The tech industry is what is holding up the s&p 500. 7 companies in particular
Just curious : What’s the thesis on shorting a brokerage firm already erroneously clobbered in March but still standing strong, with more money flowing in than out over the past quarter?    Other than the argument set out months ago that led to the sell off?   Anything new?
EOW
Next earnings
I believe I said the same thing about tesla when it was 100
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640)
You have a chance to retire, if you time that right.
Bro you don't have a brokerage account, fuck you won't even respond to this comment.
I like to be greedy when others are greedy and fearful when others are fearful.
That bubble hasn’t even started yet. And it may never. Most of the companies might stay private. Could you imagine having a company predicting your every movement and decision being public? Subjective to scrutiny… no that ain’t going to happen. It’s just a mini bubble of the biggest data scrapping companies, who is going to win the bid. And like you said there are only a few with enough money to bid.  For the foreseeable future will stay private. At least the ones that will dictate our future.
Commercial real estate , Charles Schwab is underwater. Earnings are coming up and that will expose just how troubles they are.
EOD
You were wrong about TSLA, I am not 😁
'Retire' implies I actually have a job /s
Proof? Sounds made up.  What we do know is they recently integrated TD Ameritrade which makes them the custodian with the most RIAs and RIA assets by far.  RE: NVDA though, nobody knows how far it can run when you’ve got this much buzz and mania surrounding the name. Short-term = voting machine. Long-term = weighing machine.
Maybe I’m looking in the wrong place, but they were nowhere near underwater 5 days ago and actually had the best #s on CRE.  What am I missing?    https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/big-banks-stand-strong-against-feds-commercial-real-estate-gloom-2023-06-28/
Before pre market
Takes one failed flight and suddenly no one will want to go
I’ll invest if they diversify into underwater deep sea excursions
" Spce is still risky, you either pay off your house or car in 2027 or you will sell it. "  I take that from the post, it will just go 100$ by 2027 or bankrupt.  In the meantime, go out with your dog, grab a beer, and enjoy those 4 years without thinking of that money.
The mistake people made was thinking SPCE is a space company. It’s a niche tourism company.
Why don't you average down?
5 flights per month to break even?  There isn’t that many billionaires looking to die.  Plus I wouldn’t trust the air worthiness of the craft after 30 flights.
Rocketlab is the way to play space at the moment. None of these other companies will survive. Virgin and Blue Origin are just pointless companies.
It seems like you're trying to rationalize holding on to 210 shares that have lost 87% of their value.  I get it, you're down 5,500.  No way I'd buy in right now and your post contains a lot of the reasons.  I also think you're over estimating the potential demand.  Even if the get it down to 100k, there are a lot of other much longer and enjoyable experiences available for that money that aren't a short ride into low earth orbit.  And, you'd have to have a lot of money to burn and really, really get off on it to do it twice.  Personally, I'd wait for the next inevitable spike, dump and do something more productive with the money than letting it sit, but that's me.
What have you been doing all this time if not averaging down then selling OTM calls to the schmucks with short term faith and money to spend? The past couple of weeks could've been a killing for you...
$250k buys a LOT of coke and hookers, and the fun would last a lot longer.
Knowing all these, how did you bag hold 210 shares bought at $30? You would sold it appx at $20s at least?!
SPCE occupies the same market space as Ocean Gate....they offer a product that no one needs, wildly expensive with a market limited to the ultra rich, operating in a hostile environment where one accident will crush the business.
all these hate posts on SPCE just want to make me buy.. damn it!!
If your average cost per share today is $30/share for your 210 shares. DCAing should be happening right now at these prices to massively reduce your cost per share.
Damn, I feel the OP. I only have a few shares and down about $60. With that being said I’m leaning towards selling on Monday. ANOTHER share dilution has killed it for me..
My take…. It’s going to be banned pretty soon by climate action ….. pointless journeys into space…… concord also springs to mind
SPCE is a trash company with technology that doesn’t go to orbit. Prepare for them to dilute again and again in the quest to build more of these questionable aircraft. Just mail your money to Branson instead.
I wouldn't do it even if i had the money. You need to have the money, the interest and the will to take the risk. Even Elon Musk didn't go to space.
It’s like a glorified roller coaster I can’t imagine it having a serious market. The launch was so anticlimactic I was not surprised to see the stock tank after
5 flights a week every week.. all year? There arent enough rich idiots in the world to make that sustainable
wait until they allow sex in space
Well they have about the same chance of finding a cure for cancer as they do run a profitable space tourism business…. So there’s a chance I suppose…
So calls on spce?
i just dont see the growth...and, they dont mention ai enough lol
>"They can't survive untill then" Well they have enough capital to survive untill lste 2024/early 2025 before they have to raise more capital the latest.  Q1'23 CFOps: ($136mm)  Q1'23 Cash balance: $416mm  Help me out with the math here, OP...
It is owned by a sir and there is a new king.   Funding will never be a problem.
You are all idiots if you are LT bullish on this company. If you actually think it's a good idea wait till the other craft are built and in service and then invest, otherwise you are just looking at dilution to operate.     The play on spce for the last year had been selling covered calls, that will likely be the the same thing for the next while as well.
Garbage post from a bag holder. Please ban mods
Let me know when it gets back to $30. My money is on it going to zero prior.
I bought some Thursday morning thinking that I could squeeze out a few percent if their first flight was successful.  Nope.  Immediately after takeoff it dropped 11%.
I am the inventor of a technology that makes fuel less space flight feasible. We should talk about the exciting, and promising future of intergalactic society. One asteroid the size of a vw big is worth ~1.5 trillion$ it's real. There's money to be made, even fusion can't make it in enough physical quantities yet.....
You are clearly poor and do not know how to make money.  When you are rich, your warnings will have a little value.
If they are selling experiences, the first launch looked disappointing and brief.  Not as exciting as being put on top of a rocket and launched straight up.
The reason it won’t go well is because Branson isn’t scared to use shareholder sales to fund this little dream. No one in their right mind will invest when he is selling off shares. Basically you will buy, they will sell and you will be left wondering wtf happened and then you have to hope the price comes back.
And you’re writing this post now to tell us to buy 4 years later? What kind of dumb are you?  How about we speak after 4 years if that’s when we’ll see any gains on this?
Puts on the fabric of time and space
 SPCE is a joke of a company. It will never be profitable, mark my words. Demand, in reality, is 1000 times lower than they expect
It is a two hour flight before you get ride the rocket. That seems unnecessary since the competition launches from the ground.
Space is fake any way
SPCE is hood rich. Got it.  PUTS!
SPCE is done. Sell and move on
spaceGate
What demand do you imagine that is going to sustain 5 flights a week long term?
That market just isn’t that big. Almost no one climbs Everest multiple times. You can’t compare it to Disney or a cruise.   The cost limits it to a fraction of the population.   Yes that population will slowly grow, but it’s too small.
Why not buy a leap instead?
Delta will change everything.
...perhaps i was too harsh. i say wait till the insta posts come out. if the view is amazing, there is a chance this thing could go viral and they have to build new launch pads for the demand. but at least wait for the announcements. "Due to popular demand, we will be building 10 more launch zones around the world!" or something like that.
Buy high, sell low!
After what happened to the titan, you still expect huge demand to follow for spce?
Imagine paying 450k to go on a plane that doesn’t go anywhere
with SPCE, buy the dip sell the rip and do it quick, maybe hold a few hundred shares just for kicks, but take the profits into RKLB
Even if their business model were viable, they have a habit of diluting to the point that they have just announced another dilution.
SPCE has its place and will make it. Especially with government contracts and training. Keep in mind “Space travel” isn’t just an American thing. Lots of countries will use these SPCE practice flights to pull G’s on researchers and astronauts before they launch them to the ISS. International tourism will also be massive. Because rich people will have a really easy attainable keeping up with the Joneses adventure thing that they don’t have to physically train for
They’ve underperformed projections 4 straight times, plus the risk of blowing up for $450k just isn’t appealing or going to be attainable for the vast vast vast majority of people
For any shorts playing the shelf offering keep in mind on page 21 of 46 of their latest filing, in reference to said offering, it reads: “The Shares are to be sold through any Manager on an agented basis on any day (other than a day on which the NYSE is scheduled to close prior to its regular weekday closing time)” So any offering related selling is paused until at least Wednesday.  Keep in mind they filed the offering as a well known seasoned issuer so they were able to sell shares immediately after filing on the 22nd. I guarantee you they have been. Made sense to me to cover in the short term at these levels.
 Holding a $36 bag. Will continue to hold. Fock it
Do I inverse the headline or the “dd” in the text? So confused right now.
It’s cheap and premiums are good. Cheap to pickup a few hundred shares and sell CC against. I’ve been selling CCs for years now. I’m not sure the price will rocket anytime soon, but it’s always been an easy source of revenue with periods of ridonkulously high IV. This could be regarded as financial advice if it weren’t so regarded.
here are four great reasons on why space tourism is the future: It will lower the cost of access to space and enable more human space exploration and colonization. As more people travel to space for recreation, the demand for space technologies and services will increase, creating a new market and driving innovation. This will make space travel more affordable and accessible for everyone, opening up new possibilities for scientific discovery and settlement123. It will offer a new level of sightseeing and a new perspective of our planet. Space tourists will be able to experience the thrill of weightlessness, the beauty of the Earth from above, and the wonder of the stars and planets. They will also gain a deeper appreciation of the fragility and uniqueness of our home planet, and the need to protect it123. It will inspire more people to become astronauts and boost scientific research. Space tourism will expose more people to the challenges and opportunities of living and working in space, inspiring them to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields. It will also create new opportunities for conducting experiments and observations in microgravity and other environments that are not available on Earth23. It will create a new market and consumer demand for space technologies. Space tourism will generate revenue and jobs for the space industry, as well as for related sectors such as hospitality, entertainment, education, media, insurance, etc. It will also stimulate the development of new products and services that can benefit both space travelers and people on Earth, such as advanced propulsion systems, life support systems, communication systems, etc123. I hope this helps you understand why space tourism is an exciting and promising endeavor for humanity. 🚀
Virgin Galactic gives me the same vibes as OceanGate. Just sayin.
I like the arguments posted and the accompanying qualifiers. I think they are fair.  I don’t think it will fail because I think they can evolve. People are static thinkers, they think in a straight line for whatever the current reality is. People have made this mistake with companies like Tesla and Amazon.  The question is will SPCE evolve and what will that look like. I do think its pricey right here and they need new revenue streams. As an example universities currently pay to send experiments to space on suborbital rockets. The experiments are designed to capture data in zero g for however long that lasts. I learned this from a client in Texas who launches suborbital rockets for this reason.  Right now SPCE relies too much on the ultimate theme park ride of taking people to the edge of space. I hope the plans are far beyond that. They just don’t talk about the possibilities enough in my view. I think they can be so much more.
For a fraction of the $450K to go to space, you could buy a plane and learn to fly. Then have a lifetime of great experiences.
The balloon companies (there are several) like Space Perspective are going to eat their lunch.  The TAM on Virgin Galactic is tiny and their product is like a decade late to actually capitalize on it before competition that provides a far better experience enters the market.  I'd much rather slowly ride a balloon to weightlessness with my friends than sit in a cramped plane for several hours for a couple minutes of weightlessness.
SPCE is going on an unplanned mission to the moon.
" They have good margins if their model is accurate, the poor share price is reflecting the risk of holding the stock now as they have 4 more years to become cf positive if they survive untill then. "     .... This shit is supposed to be copium post? Jesus Christ this must be bad if that's what you chose to lead with.
Just buy $RKLB lmao
one bad flight... i can't laugh
remind me 3 years
so hold the stocks like 3 years while nothing happens, well…
Then somebody will find scandalous information about corners being cut and safety being ignored. Think Titan submarine, but in space.
It happened with the Concorde after the Paris air crash in 2000.
Facts. I love OP’s analysis, but the elephant in the room is what happened with the Titan sub. It’s still fresh on everyone’s minds. Too soon.  Yet again, we human beings have the worst and shortest attention spans. So OP might be onto something with the cheap prices.   I’ll monitor the situation lol
You r right that is why nobody flies on airplanes after that 1 deadly crash
Drifting away into space with limited air and food is a horrible way to go. But also epic.
I thought it was interesting that each spot that can hold a passenger can also hold a research payload. Isn’t the flight cheap compared to conducting research in space through other channels? Flights don’t have to be full of rich buttholes. Maybe one or two buttholes and the rest paid research seats.
Not really… do you have any idea how many planes have crashed to this day?  Yet people still travel by air daily… I think the problem is the overall cost… to commercialize space they will need to drastically reduce costs and I don’t see that happening.
Also, if OP so certain why is he needing to get WSB to pump his stock up
They already have a failed flight
These billionaire projects never just implode.
Just like that imploded sub ![img](emote|t5_2th52|31226)
Modern problems require modern solutions 🫡🫶
😂 look up Virgin Oceanic
RemindMe! 4 years
Space X or a better competition would go public
Ocean gate…. Another niche tourism company…. They are nice ideas… but they simply don’t make money.
Doesn’t that require you to have more cash?
Blue Origin was awarded in a NASA contract, and god knows how they got it.
Well youre right about rocket lab but don't forget about red wire.as blue origin doubt it's gonna go bankrupt.itll fly since it's bezos's pet project  just like space x
Wish space x would become public. They would fuck!
Why is rocket lab the space play?  From what I’ve seen, they have a supposed unspecified large deal for manufacturing. Anything else?
I get the sentiment. However, when you’re stupid rich, you have a lot of time on your hands to make not so wise decisions that puts your life in danger.   There will always be a market for this and hence demand. The market is not us poor retail folks. It’s the super wealthy
OP bagholding at $30? It never even held at $30 for a length of time. To get in at $30, you bought DURING a massive rally and then didn't sell at almost 2x. I have no sympathy for this full regard, never go full regard. It's fine that happened to you, but if you still believe in this play then you need to be piling money into it at $3.
OP has not mentioned the incoming dilution anywhere in his post. It does not matter how successful a company is if its directors are willing to dilute the stock down into oblivion
So by that logic if I dropped my wallet in the drain I should throw my car keys and phone in there after it?
One hopes so, but climate action is about as likely as this company turning a profit.
Does it go beyond the Karman line?
Even if I had the money, interest and the willingness to take that risk, I wouldn't spend all that money for a few minutes of zero gravity, yes the spectacular view will be there but those few minutes doesn't justify the ticket price.
Elon bought a VG ticket to space
Because it showed everyone just how underwhelming and lame it is. Thrill seekers will wait and ride on Crew Dragon with SpaceX and get actual orbits and time to enjoy
because they announced stock dilution. They did the exact same thing before when a flight was successful.   In the past, an immediate stock dilution happened after every stock climb or successful flight event. If you search for SPCE, you even have people warning you that the stock is a high risk for dilution. https://www.tipranks.com/news/article/virgin-galactic-stock-nysespce-dont-bet-on-a-moon-shot  If anything, you should buy puts for future flight events.  flight did well = probable stock dilution and puts will print  flight exploded = puts will print
Sell the news
Aerospace has much stricter regulations than deep sea diving. Not comparable.
British Airways and Air France were losing tons of money on the Concorde. The way more spacious 777’s in the mid 2000’s we’re coming. The status of flying on the Concorde was overshadowed by comfort (if you don’t know how small and loud they were) and affordability in 1st class (meaning take a companion) on 747’s and 767’s into the early 2000’s. Plus the reduction in all final destinations. Many cities lobbied against having an air route. The air show crash was an easy excuse to retire the marvel- but it wasn’t the cause by far
More like they won't be interested in virgin galactic specifically if safety isn't guaranteed after paying 450k
There are 16,000,000+ FAA sanctioned flights a year in the US.   We haven’t had a major domestic airline crash in a couple decades in the US.   It’s literally a million times safer to take a domestic airline flight than to fly on a “spaceship”.
Uhhh, because WSB loves SPCE. It is a meme stock.

There's always cash to be made at Wendy's
Bribes
Bezos literally got his senator to make NASA open up the contract for making the lunar landing to a third company after they didn't get one of the two contracts.
10% for the big guy.
Except for the part where SpaceX is literally the best company on earth, and Blue Origin is literally pointless and incompetent
That's kind of the point.  There aren't enough stupid rich people to fill five trips a month every month unless they add value to the experience.  E.g: stay on a private island with top tier entertainment and rotating celebrity chefs then take a hovercraft to the launch pad and stay two days after the trip to wallow in decadence with your piers.  Perhaps even hire various noted scientists and rotate them through.  That would likely be something that would generate repeat business.  Regardless, we'll see
![img](emote|t5_2th52|27189)
When is that happening and how much?
Yes, double the motivation to get it back.
here are four great reasons on why space tourism is the future: It will lower the cost of access to space and enable more human space exploration and colonization. As more people travel to space for recreation, the demand for space technologies and services will increase, creating a new market and driving innovation. This will make space travel more affordable and accessible for everyone, opening up new possibilities for scientific discovery and settlement123. It will offer a new level of sightseeing and a new perspective of our planet. Space tourists will be able to experience the thrill of weightlessness, the beauty of the Earth from above, and the wonder of the stars and planets. They will also gain a deeper appreciation of the fragility and uniqueness of our home planet, and the need to protect it123. It will inspire more people to become astronauts and boost scientific research. Space tourism will expose more people to the challenges and opportunities of living and working in space, inspiring them to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields. It will also create new opportunities for conducting experiments and observations in microgravity and other environments that are not available on Earth23. It will create a new market and consumer demand for space technologies. Space tourism will generate revenue and jobs for the space industry, as well as for related sectors such as hospitality, entertainment, education, media, insurance, etc. It will also stimulate the development of new products and services that can benefit both space travelers and people on Earth, such as advanced propulsion systems, life support systems, communication systems, etc123. I hope this helps you understand why space tourism is an exciting and promising endeavor for humanity. 🚀
It’s because they announced stock dilution
People will be lining for that, just to say "I told you so".
The risk of death is estimated at 0.3% per space flight. In other words *very* risky.
That maybe so. The average human being is irrational. Bamboozled by sensationalism. Logic goes out the window and here comes irrationality fueled by negative emotions

👆A man of culture
*behind Wendy’s
Oof! 😭🤣  A fellow degenerate 🫡
except if jeff went all in and copy musk starlink.
60 flights a year at 6 seats thats 360 per year.  That's... actually reasonable, as there 8 million potential customers (viable incomes, not including bucket lists and lotto winners) in the world.  Let's assume half aren't interested in travel, and only a quarter like exotic options; meaning potential customer base is million, meaning profitability is relying on maintaining .0003% of the target demographic.
Regards indeed.  Someone send them the invitation. We will roll out the red carpet for them. They belong here with us.
400m and soon, that's how this works in this phase.    Prove viable -> dilute to fund expansion -> get those into service -> dilute to operate and market.
Haha I’m sold!
This is the wallstreetbets way.   If you don’t have double the motivation to gain it all back, then are you really regarded?
...which is where the upside comes in right?  OP is correct: I'm either paying off my house in 2027, or losing a week's pay because I took a chance to pay off my house in 2027.
I'm mean sure some rockets are going to explode, but it's not the Wild West of submersibles.   They literally bought expired aerospace carbon fiber for the sub. That says a lot. Aerospace has standards about materials.
The stat isn’t really applicable for this type of space flight. Because it’s an entirely different launch and glide strategy. Not a booster shooting straight up.
That's because there are so few manned space flights. When was the last death from a space flight though? 1984 or something?
nasa Engineers estimated space shuttle risk of failure at one percent.  The managers above them thought it was ten times less than that.  One of them were correct
They can market it as safer than deep sea tourism.
Well if a rocket gets hit by a tsunami, I think it's safe to assume it won't work.
Hey, $20 is $20
That have plans for something like starlink, can't remember it's name though.
He did the math 🤝
*~240 flights per year.   They need 4 flights per week, 4 weeks every month.
Hahaha
Aha.. But I've sold!
Really the wallstreetbets way is to wait till it runs up to 30$ then buy.     Not so much the buying down, as the waiting till explosive growth to buy in (or waiting till 3 weeks of straight selling to sell/buy puts)
If it rockets like before to like $60 then maybe yea, I will too.
Hey, play it safe, open a FanDuels account
2003 space shuttle i guess
2004 Columbus.  Don't use tiles
pretty sure NASA stands for "need another seven astronauts"
Lol!
You getting 20...
20 years between disasters sounds a lot better.
You’re getting paid? I was told this is an internship and networking gig, and I was being paid in exposure…
That depends if this is available on other places in the world than the us. Not all Apple Pay features are available outside the us and I would say in the us PayPal has lost already anyways. It’s way more used in Europe.
I'd buy the dip again on $pypl I was trading it near 60
Today I noticed McDonald’s app has an option for financing your fucking Big Mac in 4 easy payments
No fees, no interest?  What am I missing?
It’s not that great, PayPals pay later offers no interest for a year on $500+ and 6 months on $100+ which I’ve used several times for large purchases.   This would only be advantageous to use to accumulate cash back or some other kind of reward with no interest, but it only works if you have a debit card connected to Apple Pay. Read the fine print regards
Interest free? So… then what’s the incentive Goldman Sachs/Apple has on giving out these loans…? It says you may be charged overdraft fees from the bank your debit card is linked to, so my question still stands. Wtf
Paypal isn’t going anywhere but up
Klarna, AfterPay, ZipPay etc. And you thought PayPal was the only one offering 4 installments before Apple. All of the ones I mentioned are better and easier and quicker in accepting than PayPal.
Isn’t more of a threat to the installment payment companies like Affirm?
back in the day they called this predatory lending
“Early access to prerelease” is a huge nothing burger from Apple. PayPal is preferred and already everywhere. $PYPL just sold their European loan book, are buying back shares and have received buy upgrades across the board from every major analyst.  From a technical standpoint, the chart screams breakout — will blow by $70 this week.  Your puts are toast. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275)
BNPL was a low interest rate game. This is much bigger death knell for the BNPL only players like affirm, afterpay, klarna
Well everyone saying paypal to 0 so...     Calls time
PYPL already has this. So what's with the hoopla with AAPL Pay being late in the game? I don't get it.
Why is Goldman so eager to drop its partnership?
If Apple's product is as compatible with mainstream life as all other Apple products and software then PayPal does not have to worry
I think the financing is actually done through Goldman, whose looking to unload it. So might be hope for PayPal yet. Went long a little on Friday.
Apple death kneel. Trying any way to make money because they spent way to much on a helmet so I can avoid watching my wife get railed by her boyfriend.
Doesnt PayPal make most of their money off of merchant fees? As long as Apple isn’t offering merchant services I don’t see how this is relevant
BNPL is not a profitable business my man. Having that feature is more problematic than not having it for a brand lmfao
We use Klarna in Sweden for everything online (buy now, pay later)
I don't know. Remember Apple Maps?
Death knell to Banks not Paypal
Lol do you understand how few places actually accept Apple Pay? And I’m willing to bet it’s because Apple charges a heck of a premium
nice.  pay overtime with interests.   i just use those extra money and put in saving account and collect 4.80% apr
buy now pay later are just a liability. I feel better about pypl if it didn't have it.
Buy now, Pay never.
I use Klarna u can’t use apple for a lot of stuff I feel like idk maybe
does this work on buying OTM calls  asking for a friend
Just a reminder &  to let you all know that Elon musk started PayPal and sold it years ago for 179 million that’s where he got to start from
I wonder whos paying for this. Apple has a GIANT pile of money so this service makes sense for them, but someone somewhere is paying interest/fees. I am guessing it's the merchants.
I sold my paypal at $68 but I'd buy back at $60. It's heavily embedded in the eCommerce ecosystem and has pretty stable revenue IMHO.
Splitting into 4 purchases is honestly useless to me and most people I know. Maybe for people who go to Costco and spend lot of money there might be worthwhile
PayPal also has 6 months payments different than split into 4
I don't know a single person that uses apple pay. 70 percent of the world used Android, and apple pay isn't available on android.
Sold that turd with 45% loss
Finally Paypal going to zero slowly and steadily.
PayPal is used internationally. The only time I’ve ever been forced to use it is when sending payments to China. Each country has its own local payment apps, but there are still very few that are common across borders, so until some other big player is able to establish an international presence, it’ll continue to struggle along. However, PayPal is pretty shady and I only use it when I absolutely have to. That’s not a great reputation for a company to have.
I live in the US and exclusively use PayPal. I will never buy or use an Apple product. They are all overpriced garbage for hipsters
It’s true PayPal is about to be redundant, finally a post that gets it. Sorry PayPal your time as come.
Hopefully not!
These fuckin mods!!! Why are they here? Who asked its opinion?
They’ve got a lot of momentum by being integrated in payment platforms across the web. It’ll take a while before a large shift makes a dent in their earnings.
Pay pay is joke I’d take square or Sofia over it. After eBay ended their deal and eveybody that has used PayPal 4 real knows it’s garbage.
Rates will go to 9%. This economy is unstoppable! That’s when Crash of ‘87 occurred. Prime rate was over 9%. Finally stocks capitulated. Be a student of history ; because History truly repeats itself !!!!
Short to the ground
This friggin company. They had it all. They had the brand recognition and market share. They were smart and bought Braintree and Venmo. And then COVID accelerated ecomm by a decade. But they couldn't shut the door and now the barbarians are at the gates. Talk about snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. Most frustrating long position I ever took.
Oh snap
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275)
Short it then
AAPL bears can finally make full use of all the iPhones they've bought to benefit their short position, pay later then never pay back. Create the liquidity crisis that will send AAPL to the ground!!! If it fails, it's not like you can be more bankrupt than before
We have something similar in arg. No good news
I need them to open up the savings account for folks without Apple Card’s 😂😂😂😂
Just to throw another spanner in the works,  one may need to do some research on Fednow, could also be a PayPal killer in the US
I won't be using Apple, there probably are millions that won't.
Currently waiting on chime IPO launch for this exact reason
Because the only people who use PayPal also use Apple? 🤪
If Elon Musk was still at Paypal, this would never happen.
If Elon Musk was still at Paypal, this would never happen.
I've been telling friends not to buy PayPal. Everyone thinks it must go up since it dropped so much but that just isn't always the case.  Sure it might have a bit upside but it has a much higher chance of flatlining with a dividend than growth imo. I sold my PayPal at a loss and I'm happy it's out of my portfolio.
I lost so much on PYPL i want it to die miserably. And I’ve got apple stock so please kill PYPL
what moat does PYPL have? seriously. So many payment platforms out there. When i think of online payment, paypal isn't my first choice
Anyone doing a snapchat earnings play ( july 27 th)
fednow, apple pay, all the competition in the world and for whatever reason I expect pypl to explode.  Dont trust me bro, im regarded
Monetize and capitalism on recruitment gains and financial restitution
I read the other day Goldman Sachs is trying to offload the Apple card to AMEX. Not sure if it'll affect this, but it sounds like it's not an exact match made in heaven.   Also, not every retailer accepts Apple pay. Even after all this time, a lot of big retailers are hesitant to adopt.
My calls in July will print, thanks regard!
What a dumb post. This only affects US and you think even if Apple takes over bnlp from PayPal 100 to zero then PayPal will go  bankrupt? You have no clue what PayPal is and how they make money.  Bnlp is a huge risk especially in this economy. They sold $43 billion portfolio to kkr in Europe but guess what they have, customers/data now that they can funnel into thier ecosystem.
PayPal has a business outside of BNPL.   On top of that most people misunderstand the business of PayPal.   Business of PayPal is merchants. They help merchants in creating platforms like Facebook where is someone pays through their platform, PayPal takes care of the tax related stuff. Depending on location.
Some people will never touch an Apple product
PayPal sold off their BNPL loans
Calls it is
People should really focus on buying only shi they can afford to pay for in full at time of purchase.
So you have no clue about payment platforms and also that the US, for some, is not their biggest market which is also true for Apple. So I do not see how this would lead to PayPal really suffering from this   Unfortunately PNPL is nothing really new and the established way to pay in B2B. The additions are here to just create more credit cardesque debt for the endusers.  No one with sufficient funds normally uses this option.
PayPal owns Venmo though so I think it’s still a solid company
calls it is then
Idk if anyone will see this but school and work is hard rn $devking89
Looks like $PYPL is about to learn a lesson from the WSB crew! 💪🚀
In the UK, this type of BNPL option is about to become heavily regulated which has added to knocking billions off of Klarna’s value
Can coin break 80 the 4th try? Lol
Corn flying
PayPal has 2 of the top 3 app in the finance apple app charts
No, PayPal Pay In 4 (BNPL) is exploding in popularity, did you not read the last report they released on it? They control about 60% of the space already. All the other shitty ones are not accepted by many merchants or allowed to be used by many credit card companies. PayPal is not going anywhere. They literally have enough cash on hand to buy some very large banks right now.
[removed]
I live in the US. I exclusively use PayPal for online transactions if I'm not using card.
yesterday an article came out that Goldman Sachs is running from consumer debt and trying to weasel out of their contracts with Apple lol
If Amex purchases Apple’s banking suite from Goldman it’ll most likely mean global expansion
so made the money back while shorting it.
In the US lost to who exactly?

[deleted]
Been selling 80-60 puts for about the year. Got allocated at $80 once and it spiked up to $85. I normally like to hold after getting allocated but I trusted my gut and dumped for a small profit. It was the right move.   PYPL sorta undervalued but I guess it's unloved atm. It COULD rocket back up like NVDA or it could be range bound for like 10 years like TWTR was until the pandemic started. Market sentiment is mega regarded like that.
Wait till it goes to zero! Too much competition.
I bought a couple march 2024 $100 calls lol... I mean, just with a "fuck it" amount of money...
why should only the rich able to eat big Mac?  now the homeless can eat big Mac too.   :)
Probably high fees if your later on the payments. Aaand this will get people to spend more than their means.
You're putting cash in their ecosystem further by being a bank
If you pay it off in 4 payments. Otherwise fees and interest from day of loan.
My 2 cents is they have a shameful lot of cash and can afford offer the service to lure customers in to the Apple ecosystem
You bought an apple product to use it.
You're basically giving them cash for operations. And they generate so much revenue it doesn't matter how much you use it, they will have enough to repay everything. On top of that, a lot of money sitting in their payment accounts (prepaid cards) never gets used, so that's just free money for them. Starbucks has a similar business model with their loyalty cards or whatever it's called.
I’ve used the PayPal version multiple times it’s like kinda crazy cuz it’s free money.
Are there not fees involved. Lots.of credit cards let you do that for a monthly fee, ... If you recalculated that fee as normal interest you'd realize your still in a high Interest loan
paypal bagholder
It’s wild that buy now pay later has become so widespread without this narrative attached to it. It’s generally a really shitty deal for the consumer. It allows the poor to spend more and feel the pain later. Exists for no other reason.
VisualMod set to destroy apple once he becomes stronger
Funny, because the only people that bank with Apple are extreme fanboys and poors
Wtf do you mean VisualMod. !visualmod you literally roast people by saying they're poor and dumb and you're rich and intelligent.
Poor people don't own I phones
How the fuck is Tim Apple gonna get richer than Elon Musk with an attitude like that?  Edit: My bad. This is wallstreetbets, not r/antiwork, accept my apologies WSB'ers and  your wive's BFF.
When your AI is based asf.
Apparently not a lot of incentive as there was just an article about GS losing 1B from this and in talks to end the partnership.
Prob super high interest if you miss one payment
Late payments / interest. Also they make money from people using their product by charging the merchant
High retroactive interest if a missed payment or not paid off in time.   Also fees which make them defacto high interest loans
The merchant pay, check klarna
The incentive is the merchant fee, like with credit card transactions
Also, going on the recent Goldman news, Apple isnt that great at consumer finance
PayPal sucks and never finds in favor of the seller if you sell anything despite buyer fraud being rampant
I think apple has an edge how it’s integrated into apple pay. No separate app and account. Have your phone and be done with it. Otherwise it’s any other shitty player in the space.
Yes but affirm is almost already dead, my proudest accomplishment was shorting that turd from the top, I'd do it again but it could chop around 15 past your expiry before it finally dies
Doesn’t make them money like scamming the market does.
Because some nitwit began it in the first place. You just don't invite a snake into your henhouse. They are literally providing their competitor with the means to eat into their profits and clients!
Losing billions.
Fr PayPal just sold $43 billion worth of their bnpl loans and they’re better off for it
In Canada there is not a single place that doesn’t accept it. Get with the program old man.
Do you understand? Everywhere I’ve been to in the US and western Europe accepts Apple Pay.
In the US everywhere expect some restaurants and bars take Apple Pay. Where do you live?
They sold thier bnlp portfolio to kkr atleast in Europe.
You can use the physical card at non-digital POS, but it only gives 1% cash back, so like no one uses it. I suppose that will change now with the split payment option.
I know tons that use Apple Pay. Also, Apple holds majority market shares of smartphones in the US.
People are buying turds now ?
Not in Europe
Over 100 million people have iPhones. I would say competitors utilizing this pay later formula will lose significant business to Apple. Seems like a better indicator than your personal situation and musings.
They're get paid early, spot me and credit builder features are gonna change the game.
You lost the mmommmey not pypl. You only lose when you sell and you sold. Blame yourself.
What's your thesis on SNAP for that play? Otm calls or otm puts?
Goldman Sachs can’t do anything about it unless Apple approves it.
Homie, anytime Apple enters your market with their own version of your product, it is going to eat your market share. There is no question about that. It is not good news for PayPal.
Most of the money they make from these is charged to the merchant for accepting apple pay as a payment option
I just got banned from PayPal and they wouldn’t even give me an explanation. Best I could come up with was someone I sold some computer equipment to did something they weren’t supposed to and as a result anyone who had recent history with them got banned as well.  So PayPal is basically whittling whatever customers they have down to the point that it’s a 2-prong attack. Their support is awful and would not give me the $80 in my PayPal credit card rewards. Hopefully good riddance soon.
Yeah but you have way more options in the us like Apple Card but also like cashapp or venmo. All those pretty much doesn’t exist in many eu countries. You can use Apple Pay though an external credit card but that just gives you limited functionality and cashapp Venmo and similar just don’t exist at all.
That’s strange
Yeah I also learned that today after I wrote the post. Apparently amex is in talk of taking over Apple Pay which would mean that global expansion is possible. Then PayPal is fucked.
I would say a mixture of Apple Pay, google pay and cashapp. At least that would be my observation from outside the us.

I Never Even heard of those two. I don’t know if they are available from where I come. On the togetherness PayPal is accepted everywhere.
Paypal's moat is eroding constantly. So many things they do, others do (better). Competitors are coming for them from all angles. ApplePay, GooglePay, Wise, Revolut, CashApp, Stripe... 5 years ago none of these were particularly relevant. Today they're all very popular.
Btw… I bought the stock and lost money; realized its a great short - so made the money back while shorting it.
They’re large enough in the space now to be self sustaining I think
🤣🤣🤣🤣
The only smart way to use. Credit cards is to accept their free 30 days of credit and then pay them off in their entirety after each month unless it is an interest free payment. All interest, bearing, consumer credit, especially anything above 10% should be paid off immediately. I pay all of my credit cards off every month. And every month I earn thousands of dollars worth of points by putting most of my bills on these credit cards. But I am absolutely faithful in paying them off completely. and if I needed a loan, then I would use some more affordable credit.  Reasonable car loans or home mortgages are examples of reasonable credit. A short term.HELOC would be another example. But high cost debt is the enemy of any person or businesses balance sheet.
Technically not since you pay a while after getting the product. Not like gift cards.
Not yet, but next major purchase will get me to apply for their credit because they give an irresistible discount.
That doesn't make sense as they're lending you the money, you're not giving them anything. Unless you don't repay on time, in which case they make money from the interest.
No fees, most people are unable to make good financial choices and a good portion of Apple Pay customers will end up paying interest which is where apple and Goldman Sachs make their money.
PayPal: “But wait! I’m nice now!”
doesn't PayPal have the exact same pay in 4 instalments feature?
Also the interest is just rebranded as fees in many of the bnpl schemes
Well, if you were wise, even if you had the cash to buy a new phone, it would be silly to put the cash upfront for it when they offer interest free monthly payments. You can invest the cash and pay the monthly payment with no cost. Win win
It doesn’t trap people into poverty, just makes fun of people for getting into poverty

Can confirm *sent from blackberry
They claim no interest or fees.  > Apple Pay Later doesn't charge any fees or interest, even if your loan account goes past due.  https://support.apple.com/en-lamr/HT213543
Did you read that?
Both of these... I think Apple is trying to have a hand in too much shit to keep growing and it's not sustainable. Once they get to Apple House it's over.
+1 to that. I am a seller on PayPal for my business. I have to provide proof of shipment all the time otherwise my funds are frozen. Looking for alternatives as we speak.
But why? Which part is losing them money is it just the service costs or did they give out too many bad loans? Do they explain why?   I got my Apple card and savings and loving it so far, works great, deposits cash back straight to your savings every day. I deposited like $50k into their savings too. How are they losing money???
ya i know they unloaded some of the risk don't remember how much they sold.
Well that's one country. So they have that going for them, which is nice.
Yet..
Oh I get it. There's 100 million people with iPhones because they absolutely can't handle anything more complicated. But there's still 3.6 Billion android users for the other companies such as Paypal to work with.
Well ai seems to be the craze right now. Last week the ceo said 300+ million people have used it. He also said 4+ million people signed up for snap+ which is $4 a person all that since last earnings. The earnings is soon so i am making a bet on it  https://preview.redd.it/lg4xnx5ckr9b1.png?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9f27add654e0a84a81490f8dd6e61630c8cc454d
Banks can do what they need if it doesn't make them dollars. I'm sure Apple has to sign off on something, but Goldman can offload them if they so please. Pretty sure there's a clause in the contract.
Which the costs then get passed onto the consumer through having the fee tied into cost of products. You think the retailer is going to absorb losses from payments fees? 😂😂![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)
PayPal is fucking garbage, especially when it comes to unnecessary bans
The options aren't as vast as they seem in thee US. Venmo is owned by PayPal.
How so
It’s not CashApp - cashapp supports P2P, but not things like online shopping except from the tiny merchants, which represent an insignificant part of the market compared to a Walmart or Best Buy
Apple pay started in 2014, android pay/Google pay started in 2013 and PayPal split from ebay in 2015. PayPal is for more massive that those two. Google had to rebrand Google pay cause it was such a flop.  I don't think PayPal has them to worry about. Once PayPal is in the app store they are fine. The PayPal app has so much more financial features. It is a super app.
Wow, you have no clue about PayPal's business. Where to start.  Bnlp is not a money maker. Let's look at klarna that is only bnlp. It made a profit in 2018 and has not made a profit since. It has nothing else.  PayPal got into the bnlp business for customer data to funnelt into the ecosystem and bolster thier customers. Same reason they bought honey, for the customer. That is the reason they sold thier portfolio for 43 billion to kkr. They keep the business, customer data and no risk since they sold it. Don't have to worry about customers defaulting.  Apple only appeals to apple customer. Apple pay is only apple. No one outside of apple will use apple pay while PayPal is on android and apple. Apple ecosystem is huge but it doesn't benefit then from a profit stand point. They already have the customer data since they have phones already. No one is going to buy an iPhone cause they are offered bnlp. I can see it affecting smaller bnlp companies but apple pay has been there since 2014 and PayPal separated from ebay in 2015 yet PayPal is massive. I don't think they are afraid of apple.   Amazon has Amazon pay but that is so featureless. The PayPal app can do so much more. Crypto, PayPal credit, bnlp, business loans, sending money, point of sale, etc.  I have never heard anyone ever using the words Amazon pay for anything.  Now I don't think PayPal can grow forever but what you said is just untrue.
Oh great visual mod, tell us your great vision! 🧙🏼‍♂️
What do you mean, step-mod?
Someone mistaking you for VisualMod is probably the greatest accidental compliment you'll ever receive
Is that from your exp as a consumer? merchant? investor?  The company I work for runs a site with normal merchant processing plus Paypal. Regular merchant processing already includes googlepay and applepay so they don't pay separately for those. Then again the mobile rate is lower on their site. Maybe paypal is losing the mobile front and the younger consumer?
Waited for a position to buy the stock but it’s not making me buy as it positioned downwards, thanks to me didn’t buy it,,
They have hooked many with easy pay in 4. I used PayPal often but now constantly use it to break large purchases into 4, hold my cash in high yield savings/T-bills longer and use my credit card for the installments which gives additional time to pay without interest so they have made a “zero-fee” service into something that can actually make you a little extra money as you pay something off.
One other note, I take all my points in cash redemption. When I look up to see if there is any value play in using them to purchase something I am offered, I have never seen a good deal. I do know people who use the points for airline upgrades, so maybe that would work. But I have never tried that because I don’t wanna be tied one airline.
Oh well then, I stand corrected. Thought it may be like chase / amex pay over time
Yeah but PayPal is not Apple
Except, you know, the fees..... They just relabel the interest as fees .. and it clearly works
 Interest free prolonged purchases don’t exist, why would they? It’s unnecessary liability taken on by the company. They just call it convenience fees or something similar.
if you were wise, a couple months of interest on the cost of a phone wouldn’t be worth the hassle of paying in installments
Double confirm *sent with my Jitterbug
Oh, so literally free money. Cool.  I expect this to be taken behind the barn by this time next year.
Pretty wild. They’re probably just willing to lose money for a year to gain market share before destroying people. Not to mention the personal spending data they’re collecting
Turns out there aren't fees apparently. I thought it was like chase / amex pay over time type of thing
Apple House is great! Everything just works and I can’t add anything onto it after purchase which doesn’t matter, because in 5 years this model will be obsolete and ready to recycle and I’ll start payments on my new Apple House.
Sell to people you know via zelle or venmo
Yep. I got hosed on a legit electronic ticket sale. Showed all the texts and emails from the verified email and phone number for the person. Showed the email matched the email in the ticket transaction as did the name of the person. The person went and enjoyed the game, then a week later filed for a refund because he was unaware of the transaction. He got his refund,and I got screwed because I physically didn't ship him an electronic ticket transfer. In hindsight I should've mailed him a copy of the transfer receipt. And that probably would've covered my ass.
Was worth $43 billion. For past and future loans.
Nah it’s because they can afford better than the bloatware trash android makers put out.
If Apple has to sign off on it, then they can’t offload them “if they so please”. Apple chose Goldman for a reason. Goldman has prestige to their name. Apple would never allow them to be able to offload their brand to anyone at will. American Express is also prestigious, so I don’t really see an issue with it on Apple’s side, but you’re fooling yourself if you think Apple would let them sell it to just anyone whenever.
It’s both consumer and retailer who take the hit. I sucked at Econ but that’s just 101 stuff.
Zelle
and PayPal is owned by eBay!
PayPal feels very dated, I haven't even used venmo in over 5 years.  I'm just surprised you used PayPal.
I've also heard so many scam stories off paypal that i simply avoid it.
Wait. It does not? I didn’t knew that. Why tf do people then even use cashapp. Just use PayPal friends and family and you have everything in one app.

All 3 of the above. Merchant/consumer/investor. Mostly merchant.  \~Five years ago, every small business HAD to have Paypal on their site. Not having Paypal meant your conversion rate would plummet. Nowadays, that's not the case. Either way, this is still Paypal's best business model. They allow merchants to easily set up online payment processing.  That said, Stripe is a major competitor in online processing. IMO, their product is far superior. Paypal is renown for screwing merchants, closing their account, freezing or even stealing all the money in their balance. Their reputation is absolute trash, and they deserve it.   As for p2p transfers, they are dead. Wise / Revolut are WAY better, both cost-wise and ease of use. Paypal was charging up to 10% for this type of service when it involved a cross-border transaction. They take 3-4% on conversion, 4-5% on receiving + sending fees, then have other ways to tack on extra (withdrawal fees, second conversion, etc.). Meanwhile, Wise/Revolut cost 0.5-1% depending on currency / destination.   Businesses will also notice that the MassPay / Payouts feature is more expensive than alternatives. Wise/OFX and other batch payout providers are doing this for <1% as well. The margins in online payments have eroded due to competition. Paypal used to be the only game in town.
Well for instance apple also has 12 month no interest financing on their new MacBook air 15in with no fees besides taxes. Before taxes it's 1299.00 or 108.25/mon 12mon which is 1299. 00. This is on their website directly. It's because they make more money after you buy the device than when you buy it lol. Not to mention all the people that will fail to pay on time and incur very high interest.
All is well until they send the repo man after your phone, which they can track.
Venmo is paypal
The retailer only takes a temporary hit until it recovers from selling its merchandise.
Zelle is horrible,  I constantly have issues with it...  My two banks fight over the information constantly, I have to call the banks to delete my info every week. Then put my info back in again, every week.  Their customer "service" is non existent. Just a phone recording that loops, then hangs up. I travel a lot, so have been to two of their "offices" they are both empty/ no one ever there.  I believe it is a government honeypot. Think about it. Zelle is not required to disclose the 600/yr limit for payments. As the government already has the information. Another of the addresses at one time was a government office of record, during the pandemic they changed it since.  That's just my theory and research.
Doesn't feel dated to me. Don't see why it would need to feel "modern" either way. It's an online payment service. There's not much to it.
CashApp has amazing marketing. It’s the only fintech app to make it into rap songs lol, nobody is rhyming “PayPal friends and family” with shit lol  Square, which owns CashApp, is one of the few fintech stocks doing even worse than PayPal
Ye PayPal has its issues but affirm, after pay or klarna are not profitable.  I want PayPal to reach new heights but it is a tough road ahead.
I believe that’s with approval of the Apple Card, which includes a standard 0% apr introductory purchase (6-24 months). So it’s not bc they make more money just by selling the MacBook anyway possible, its to rope you in on the Goldman Sachs backed card long term. For most, that won’t be the only purchase. AAPL also has far more cash than most countries so they can do these things. It’s not an easy approval
Yea I know and they’re becoming just as difficult
I am in tech and it’s just my opinion; I don’t hear the name much anymore and was surprised it’s still around after seeing this thread.
I firmly place PayPal in the pre-Facebook era of technology.  That was nearly 25 years ago.  That’s why I say it’s dated.
I definitely stand by my comment that it’s remarkable that anyone remembers the company.  Their product has no technical moat and innovation is limited.
Oh ok. TIL
CashApp makes nothing on transactions. I guess now that interest rates are 5%, they can at least invest some client funds into short term treasuries. But most people don't hold much in CashApp.
.
You know you can combine your responses into 1 comment right? Someone who works in tech should know that.  You seem to have something personal against PayPal. Perhaps you assisted a Nigerian prince through PayPal?
PayPal sold thier past and future bnlp portfolio in Europe to kkr for 43 billion so no risk there, they still handle the originations. Get all the customers signed up to thier ecosystem. All growth. All that is left is Germany and USA. Germany is minor and I am not sure about USA but it is not as bad as the European economy.
Sure I could have but they were different thoughts in different moments and I felt like making new ones.  Not much else to say.
He must work for Xerox or Blackberry 😂
.
It will never see 300 again but 120 is possible.
Not sure you work at PayPal or not cause you don't seem to know how PayPal works. I am kinda puzzled by the comment. Oh well. We will see how pypl performs in the future.
Trust me, I know a whole lot more on this than you do. There’s a lot that’s not being reported publicly. If you somehow believe that Apple Pay isn’t a major threat, more power to you. We need more people like you
Could be right. Who knows what these companies have planned. It is hard to make a decision based on nothing so far. Thanks for the caution and I will keep PayPal as a short term stock.
Also I forgot to add that apple is not infallible Goldman Sachs is looking to end its partnership with Apple (per WSJ):  Goldman Sachs is looking to end its partnership with the Apple Card, per WSJ.      Goldman Sachs $GS lost over $1 Billion dollars due to its Apple $AAPL partnership.   This is 2 years into a 10 year deal.  Apple can make products but no have no clue about the financial world. PayPal has so much experience here. Apple pay later is a money hole for them. That is why PayPal sold thier loans to kkr. They know.
I think they said the battery only lasts 2 hours. You need multiple batteries to use it all day. I have VR headsets. The longest I used one is 4 hours playing games. That was all my eyes could take. The Vision Pro has higher resolution display so maybe that is easier for eyes.
Its part of the Apple lifestyle.  If you have other Apple devices then this vision pro will fit into your life. Go ahead and pre order it ASAP.  Papa Tim Apple approves.  The vision pro comes with a power cable so you can be connected to it all day if that pleases you.
Quest is better
I always thought of it as a replacement for the MacBook with better immersion. My concern (being someone that’s owned multiple VR headsets) is the comfort in wearing it for extended periods of time. I will have to experience it to know.  I think what’s more important are the input interfaces. Eye tracking and gestures over straight up typing via keyboard will be interesting. Being a software engr, can this truly make my life easier writing code and collaborating cos I think that will be the biggest demographic willing to shell out $3499 out of pocket.
It's gonna be a big failure like meta quest 2. People who buy IPhones don't care about technically groundbreaking stuff like VR, they just wanna look cool and rich. I'm sure a bunch of losers will buy it to flex but most people won't drop $3500 on something they won't use. It doesn't really have groundbreaking feature for a vr headset anyway, literally is just an IPhone/Macbook for your eyes, business aren't gonna spend $3500 for something they have already. It will probably be shitty at running games if It can at all. I don't think it will be a total financial failure but when investors don't see it literally in everyone's hands the will get spooked and sell. Im gonna buy puts before release and then buy shares after the stock tanks because let's be real, apple won't fail as a company.
Depends on the killer apps
$3500 price cap. I can buy one MacBook Pro and an iPad Pro . Where does this product even fit . Who is it meant for ? -gaming , entertainment or checking emails ? How much time can you spend on this thing without becoming a social pariah ? Imagine spending $3500 on a product and not knowing what to do with it and letting it collect dust just because it’s from Apple
It has a cable to a battery pack on your belt. Hipsters may like that I guess.
It’s a MacBook with multiple 4k monitors on your head. I think right now it’ll be developers who use this to do their shit as you basically need to be connected to a wall since the battery life isn’t very long. Basically it saves them desk space, hassle of setting up monitor arms, and buying three 4k displays.   Pretty useless for me but I could see this useful for certain software developers, especially those short on space.
Apple could sell a monitor stand for $1000 and people would buy it... Oh wait...
Buy $AAPL now and use the profit to buy vision pros later
People will, who thought people will stare at their phones all day .. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260)
You can use it plugged into power…
shit sounds terrible for your eyes.. and they want you to work all days in one of these eye death traps
2 hours is plenty, only need 2 minutes to wank.
Did they really say only 2 hours? Damn thats not very impressive.
>Dented water tank. What to do?  It's also really heavy
live in the abyss
Close. Porn lovers first, then software engineers. Somewhere the venn diagram overlaps
!RemindMe 1 year
The only killer app is Pornhub. But is is banned by AAPL.
Like the Apple Watch it’s not ready to be bought and used yet. They’re hoping for the early adopters to pick it up and run with it and after 5 years it’ll just become a normal thing everyone has.
It’s not that bad once you get used to VR. As long as the framerate and clarity stays high then the strain to eyes should be minimal
But the batteries that they have can extend the time but they aren’t very light or small.
You can use it plugged into power…

Web browsers exist.
But the Apple Watch is on your wrist all day . Can you put this $3500 thing on your face all day ? Facebook, which has a cheaper version , doesn’t even release numbers of how many of their VR they sold . I got a friend who bought the Facebook VR. He said the last time he used it was 2 years ago.
Kinda wild that they don't want people using their mouse with a wire plugged in, but are totally fine with people having a wire dangling off their face lol
facebook does say how much they lose on it and it's alot plus they are selling less year over year.
I’m with you, I’m not at all sold on the current iteration of VR.
The answer to this is that the fear & greed (F&G) index is basically an oscillator, and oscillator indicators measure the strength of a movement, NOT the probability of its reversal as so many think, and the behavior of these indicators depends a LOT on market conditions. However, when you zoom out, those behavioral tendencies get washed out by the overall trends, so people draw the wrong conclusions.  What you'll hear on here a lot is contrarian style trading advice: "Inverse X to predict the direction of the market."  Most of this comes from youtube or tiktok or some random site people went to. These contrarian oscillator tacticals are all over the place.  A simple example is the common RSI strategy that suggests selling once RSI reaches 70. You can look at a chart and easily see that RSI generally reverses after getting into overbought areas, so going short on RSI > 70 should work, right?  Actually, no... because RSI can reset by flat trading or run for an extended period of time during high momentum periods. Lots of bears in the daily thread blow up their accounts buying puts on overbought RSI. People do the same playing VIX in a contrarian way, like the mouthbreather the other day who said that VIX always predicts a reversal on the 1H timescale.  Then the market shot straight the fuck up over the next day and a half.  If you really want to understand these indicators, you have to understand what's behind them. In the case of RSI, it's literally intended to be a strength indicator, not a reversal indicator. Overbought RSI actually usually means the stock runs if it happens during a bull trend... and people playing the RSI game during bear markets and then transition to bull markets get washed out until they figure out the trend has turned against them and the behavior of price action compared to indicator changes.  F&G works the same way. A lot of the factors in F&G index are basically momentum indicators, so like these other oscillators, it trends in one direction whenever the market is running like it is now. This is especially true during bull market trends that start immediately after a bear market because an increases in confidence and change in direction resets the trading patterns for institutions, who are now building positions for forward return with a knowable cost of capital and risk-free rate of return.  Everybody's focused on whether the next quarter will have an earnings recession, but ignoring that everyone expects that, and for the one after, and like 6 quarters of projections on this have been wrong, and that the market looks beyond basic, small recessions.  What these people will do on here is tell you that "it's guaranteed to happen" and the ones who are being honest about their beliefs (who are far fewer than we may want to accept) will then blow up their accounts like they have for the last 9 months going short against the market on a "sure thing" contrarian tactic because they failed to understand the implications of the chart they were looking at.  Those are the same people who told you that regional banks work like moneycenter banks and some regionals collapsing meant the whole system was coming down... they don't.  They're the same people saying CRE is as tied into the market as housing... it isn't, the stress tests just showed that.  They're the same people who said that debt ceiling deals cause the market to crash... that was just a bald-faced lie.  They're the same people who predicted that the treasury would immediately dump $3T in bonds on the market crashing it... that was also a lie.  Now they're the ones saying the 0.33% of consumer spend that encompassed the total projected yearly student loan payments is a "black swan event" even though it comes out to about $10B/year in real impact to retail once all is taken into account against $60T in spending. Basically, it's a rounding error... but that doesn't feed the fear narrative, so it'll be exaggerated ad nauseum by people on here.  So the moral of the story is: Don't listen to these people. Oscillators don't magically predict movements. They often work in many circumstances and don't work in others. Market patterns depend a lot on the stage of the market cycle you're in... what works in one will not work in another. Anyone who says anything in the market is a "sure thing" or "always works this way" is either wrong or lying in some way or is waiting to be proven wrong at some point.  And even if you're right, the market can still trend long enough to rob you of any gains.  This game is not so much about being right as it is about being positioned correctly to be right enough... and being correct that an oscillator will reverse at some point in the future doesn't matter when you lost 30% to gain 10%. "But I was eventually right" doesn't change the color on the P&L sheet. LOL  Now these things can work to feed into your strategy. I buy less when we're in overbought territory and consider it as a factor, same with Fear and Greed... but keep in mind that you also have to put them into the strength category. Extended F&G doesn't mean bears will get their day, it means bulls have been right for almost 9 months... and the same people saying F&G predicts that this will turn around were saying the same thing 8 months ago... and 7 months ago... and 6 months ego... etc...  So remember the most important piece of advice you can get in the market: The trend is your friend. Don't fight it.  Oh and you know who said the current trend isn't fighting the Fed the other day?  JPOW.  So fight this trend at your peril.
I would hope you do more analysis and due diligence than just a greed indicator made by CNN.   Check the trends, news, data, company stature,and know your price ranges. Then make your decision.
I am also looking for an answer to this, but this sub is full of assholes making jokes and like 5% actual answers.   My question is does extreme greed always mark a month or two correction?
Greed gets greedier and fear gets fearier
Ok calls on TSLA tomorrow
If you go back and look... there have been multiple years in this bull market where it went parabolic upwards with no pullbacks.  The covid bounce, 2017-2019 was good too.
I m a greedy mfer, 🙋🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️, upvote if you are one, upvote if you ain’t one too, cause greediness is being human 🧏🏻‍♂️
Extreme greed right now
Yeah. The Great Depression (see lore). The issue right now is that we usually boom and bust. Growth followed by recession to cool things off and pay on debts. However we’ve been doing A LOT of booming.. and completely passed the last “we should chill here”  marker. Now regards think the market can’t go tits up and are making increasingly riskier plays to get the biscuit.  Lore: After WW1 the US basically got all the work orders to rebuild Europe. This created a lot of liquidity, and people went ape shit buying houses, cars, etc. imagine The Great Gatsby. They also dumped money into the market which couldn’t go tits up, second mortgages into the market, loan money dumped into the market, but the catalyst was foreign money investing too, because things couldn’t go tits up but ultimately drove growth to unfathomable levels. Before you know it deflation appears, ppl stop spending money because it’s appreciating on its own, compared to inflation where it loses money and incentivizes you to spend it and becomes the aggregate demand that drives the economy, jobs get wiped out, companies go out of business, market dumps, bank runs, all hell breaks loose.
This time it's different!!!
So you have an indicator which works, but now you're just gonna ignore it for unknown reasons. Lmao excellent analysis
That index is not better than reading daily thread. It was ahowing extreme fear (for a long time) when we are near the bottom. Like, thanks Captain Obvious?
Loading up on SQQQ
I've followed the fear and greed for a while now.  It's solid.  Extreme greed has always been an amazing sell point and extreme fear has always been an amazing entry.  If I followed these alone I'd be 100% green on trades.  Not max profit, but wins.  Problem with fear and greed is you need to be longer than anyone here is.
Happens all the time. Just ignore it.
Has no one has ever said, greed doesn't exist. Only existence.
That chart is misleading. We had major drops before, so of course now it looks like its a massive greed rally.  Yes SP500 is at ATH, but thats because of the top few stocks, most stocks are far from ATH. Then also the high pace of interest rate hikes creates some weird scenarios in bond rates.  I'm bearish but this isn't really that meaningful
It's a good indicator in bear markets but harder to use in bull markets or turning points between the two as far as I've seen the past 5-6 years.  So, it may not be useful unless we go back to full on bear market.  Was pretty useless in 2021.
This indicator is a combination of several indicators, each giving a hint of the direction we are going, but sometimes giving mix signals. So now breath is somewhat good, but yields are pointing in another direction. These indicators itself all can give you a good outlook, but sometimes the combination can give mixed signals. As for hanging longer in extreme greed, I don't think that is very likely, since the ratios move all the time, but this doesn't mean that we'll go to extreme fear in one time.
What did Daddy JPow say about fighting the Fed??
Great post, and I can get on board with the idea that all the fear/greed and overbought/oversold momentum indicators may not necessarily be a sign of an impending reversals, and that macro-economic doom predictions may mostly  be just noise...  ...But I will die on my gay bear hill with my belief that Tesla, Nvidia, and all of crypto are all extremely over-valued at these prices and shall face a reckoning (again) sooner or later!
i aint readin alat
Idk ... CNN seem like experts on fear and greed 🤔
Well of course... it is just one indicator that aggregates several things to measure sentiment.
It's usually the opposite to be honest. When the 7 inputs to that fear/greed index are pegged at "Greedy as fucking shit", the markets are rallying hard, and continue to do so until valuations are fucking wayyy past crazy again.  These markets are just one búbble cycle to the next. That index was fuckin Pegged at extreme greed for what seems like all of 2021. Would have been a great time to be invested.  Tbh, stocks only go up isn't even a meme at this point, WW3 couldn't stop this.
regards get graspier. Soon lambo
Lmao
I did that earlier this year and got crushed.
It does not happen all the time... It can stay extended for a couple of weeks or so but anything longer than that would be rare
Last week in Europe Sara Eisen asked him if he was concerned about the market's behavior and if it was fighting the Fed and not what he wanted and he basically joked about not fighting the Fed and said that he didn't view what the market was doing right now as fighting them, and that the market can run and they can still do their job and in fact that's often what they want to see.  He got the chance to basically say "this is a problem and it needs to come down" and instead basically blessed the run.
Oh I think you're probably right that there's some solid excessiveness happening in some sectors. Whether people want to call it a "bubble" or not is a dynamic conversation that probably depends on the stock.   I just want to make sure people are smart enough to do the extra work so they get that thesis as close to right as possible and aren't just chasing it and losing money. :P
Nah. That’s Fox you’re thinking of.
I know what you mean. I turned $241 into a $18k withdrawal and $8k set aside for taxes just in May/June. I want to get back in with a new account. I was even up to $76k for an hour the day before the rally paused last week.
I just listened to the podcast 'We study billionaires' where they covered the book Market Cycle by Howard Marks. They then spoke to him and he literally said what you said here. Markets just get fueled into overdrive in one direction. It's a pretty good listen on how irrational the market can get.
You’re wrong.
Maybe not that rare, but it’s an indicator that shouldn’t be ignored for short term buyers. Everyone knows the saying that goes along with it...
Same product different target consumer
